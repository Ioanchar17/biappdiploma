"these work great even though i do not have an iphone, i use them with my android phone and i was worried about compatibility issues but gratefully i did not come across any. i got them over the other in-ear headphones because my ear starts to ache if something is inside it too long. these are perfect as they stay just near the outer part allowing my inner ear to get some breathing space. sound quality is great as expected from the brand however the noise cancelling could be better. but that is a price to pay for my ear to not be fully closed off. a lot of the advertised features do not work because i am not using an iphone (such as siri, ear detection or even battery detection - which can be frustrating). but here are some features that did work:- you cannot double tap to get to siri (or google) but the double tap instead works to pause or play the media!- you can still use just one earphone since they both connect differently. (will need to change settings to allow for mono audio, this can be found in accessibility).",positive,work great even though iphone use android phone worried compatibility issue gratefully come across got inear headphone ear start ache something inside long perfect stay near outer part allowing inner ear get breathing space sound quality great expected brand however noise cancelling could better price pay ear fully closed lot advertised feature work using iphone siri ear detection even battery detection frustrating feature work double tap get siri google double tap instead work pause play medium still use earphone since connect differently need change setting allow mono audio found accessibility

"i wanted to try some of these and when they had a good price here on amazon i went ahead and purchased a pair  i was not prepared to pay the price for the newest version. i also have a set of beats earbuds which are very nice and probably fit my ear a bit better but that is mainly because they sort of twist into your ear. these being a different thing altogether, where they slide into your ear and hang there is nice because they do not pop out, on the other hand the sound quality is going to work better if they fit tightly in your ear versus loosely so a lot of that is is going to depend on the individual. they have fine audio reproduction but as you might expect with such small speakers the base is a bit light and the noise cancellation seems to work but it is only going to work if there is a good seal around the earbud and the ear itself so once again that is going to depend on your ear. they are slightly larger than some but i did not find that to be a problem. they  work well in a work out, mainly because if you are going to use earbuds and are using ones that fit tightly into your ear, like beats, they are more likely to work their way out during your exercise program as you move your head and so forth. if they seem a good price you cannot go wrong",positive,wanted try good price amazon went ahead purchased pair prepared pay price newest version also set beat earbuds nice probably fit ear bit better mainly sort twist ear different thing altogether slide ear hang nice pop hand sound quality going work better fit tightly ear versus loosely lot going depend individual fine audio reproduction might expect small speaker base bit light noise cancellation seems work going work good seal around earbud ear going depend ear slightly larger find problem work well work mainly going use earbuds using one fit tightly ear like beat likely work way exercise program move head forth seem good price go wrong

"airpods second generation is wireless bluetooth earbuds designed by apple inc. they are white wireless earbuds that come inside a case that uses bluetooth from your phone. you can watch videos, listen to music, or even hear anything that comes from your phone. they know when they are inserted in your ear and are ready to work as soon as you put them in, and additionally, they will pause audio automatically when you remove them. the product is really easy to use. all you have to do is put them in your ear, go to your setting and connect them to your phone, and play whatever you like from your phone.  i have had this product for  years now and i still love them even though they come out with new ones almost every year or . my experience with airpods has been great. i have not ever had a problem with my airpods. i feel like the second generation is enough for me because all the generations work the same, they just get better and louder, and since i have had them for so long i think it is time for me to upgrade and get new ones. everybody i know uses this product, and they love them. airpods are really popular in the teenage world, almost every teenager has a pair of airpods, and loves them.  air pods sound fantastic for their size, and the battery life for the airpods alone are great for their size, the charging case battery life is actually  times better than the airpods battery life to me the charging case stays charged longer than the actual airpods. airpods have an amazing microphone, you can talk to siri through airpods, and make phone calls, and have amazing sound. they do not only connect from your iphone but they can connect from your ipad, or apple watch as well, which is great for when you do not have your phone but still want to listen to music.  there are not many cons with airpods, but there are a few. air pods are really tiny, but that does not affect the sound in any way, it only affects if it will stay in your ear for so long, or if they do not fit your ears at all, because a lot of people tend to have a problem with them not fitting in everyone is ears, and since they are so tiny, it is really easy for them to get lost or misplaced definitely if they fall out of your ear and you do not even notice that they have fallen out. they are also easy to get misplaced if you do not put them back into the case right away after using them. all apple products are pretty much waterproof, but i feel like this is the only product that is not waterproof, and if they keep improving and making better ones they should all be waterproof. airpods are not good for athletes, or for people who just like to work out because if you are doing a lot of moving with these airpods in your ear  times out of  they will fall out.  i highly recommend someone to buy airpods. they are good for everyone. if you are just chilling, or just love music, or want to talk on the phone they are really convenient to people who do not like holding their phones up to their ear when they talk. as i said before, everyone i know around me has airpods and they are definitely great for teenagers. they will be a wonderful gift for someone, they are worth the price because the sound is amazing and they close out everything else around you.",positive,second generation wireless bluetooth earbuds designed inc white wireless earbuds come inside case us bluetooth phone watch video listen music even hear anything come phone know inserted ear ready work soon put additionally pause audio automatically remove product really easy use put ear go setting connect phone play whatever like phone product year still even though come new one almost every year experience great ever problem feel like second generation enough generation work get better louder since long think time upgrade get new one everybody know us product really popular teenage world almost every teenager pair love air pod sound fantastic size battery life alone great size charging case battery life actually time better battery life charging case stay charged longer actual amazing microphone talk siri make phone call amazing sound connect iphone connect ipad watch well great phone still want listen music many con air pod really tiny affect sound way affect stay ear long fit ear lot people tend problem fitting everyone ear since tiny really easy get lost misplaced definitely fall ear even notice fallen also easy get misplaced put back case away using product pretty much waterproof feel like product waterproof keep improving making better one waterproof good athlete people like work lot moving ear time fall highly recommend someone buy good everyone chilling music want talk phone really convenient people like holding phone ear talk said everyone know around definitely great teenager wonderful gift someone worth price sound amazing close everything else around

"i waited a long, long time before buying apple ear pods. i have used skull candy, soundpeats, and a host of others. they all have their little quirks and variations. the apple ones do as well, but not nearly as many. overall, the quality of these is awesome. the sound is great, it allows for pass through sound so i can listen to music and still hear whats going on around me, and the charge lasts for several hours.the downside(s). first, my ears do not necessarily fit these (or the wired ones that always came with the iphones), so i have to adjust and push these in every once in a while. i know thats why they came out with the pro ones with the plastic ear bud. those will be the next pair i get. secondly, live listen works great, with one caveat. i would have imagined that the mic used would have been the mics on the ear buds themselves. nope. it uses your phone mic. so, if you put your phone in your pocket and have live listen on, you hear the phone shuffling around in your pocket. in other words, you have to leave your phone out (laying on your desk, holding it in your hand, etc.) in order to use it with any success. maybe that changes on other models, but for these, it makes the live listen almost pointless. i want to be hands free, with my phone in my pocket, but be able to hear someone if they talk to me. not sure what else the concept would have been used for in using the phone mic.other than those issues, i really have no complaints. the case charges the pods quickly and multiple times, so you can continue to use them for a long time. again, sound quality is as good, if not better, than any other ear buds ive used. you can set what the functions are, so tapping the right ear twice can mean whatever you want versus tapping the left ear twice.i am really pleased with these and would recommend them.",positive,waited long long time buying ear pod used skull candy soundpeats host others little quirk variation one well nearly many overall quality awesome sound great allows pas sound listen music still hear whats going around charge last several hoursthe downside first ear necessarily fit wired one always came iphones adjust push every know thats came pro one plastic ear bud next pair get secondly live listen work great caveat would imagined mic used would mics ear bud nope us phone mic put phone pocket live listen hear phone shuffling around pocket word leave phone laying desk holding hand etc order use success maybe change model make live listen almost pointless want hand free phone pocket able hear someone talk sure else concept would used using phone micother issue really complaint case charge pod quickly multiple time continue use long time sound quality good better ear bud ive used set function tapping ear twice mean whatever want versus tapping ear twicei really pleased would recommend

"i did not know if these were worth the money considering that these seemed like glorified regular earbuds. i actually like these better. while the price is high, it seems worth it in my couple months of owning them. i got these for my first semester at college to ignore people and listen to bomb ass music without looking too broke. first off, these are pretty good with noise canceling. i can hear people sometimes if the music is low enough, but the sound is more muffled. it is great when i want to pay attention to my work or ignore people as they tune out people and they also make it a universal sign of ""do not talk to me"" which is great when i do not want to talk to others in public. even if i am not listening to music! the other great thing is the fact that it is quick to charge and the battery life is pretty good!in comparison to regular earbuds or even headphones is the fact that they are easy to pack and easy to access. headphones are bulky and generally awkward (for me at least) to have around the neck. however, airpods are really easy to put in and then when you are done using them, you put them back in the small compact case. another is the lack of wire. i do not know about you, but for me the lack of wire is much easier. when i am in the mood to listen to something with my earbuds, i no longer need to un-knot the earbuds but simply take them out of the case. so like i said, i really like these and enjoy the easy access and the small compactness of this as well as the increase in sound quality and battery life. if i could rate this out of , i would give it an honest .",positive,know worth money considering seemed like glorified regular earbuds actually like better price high seems worth couple month owning got first semester college ignore people listen bomb as music without looking broke first pretty good noise canceling hear people sometimes music low enough sound muffled great want pay attention work ignore people tune people also make universal sign talk great want talk others public even listening music great thing fact quick charge battery life pretty goodin comparison regular earbuds even headphone fact easy pack easy access headphone bulky generally awkward least around neck however really easy put done using put back small compact case another lack wire know lack wire much easier mood listen something earbuds longer need unknot earbuds simply take case like said really like enjoy easy access small compactness well increase sound quality battery life could rate would give honest

" star because although they are amazing, i am now on my th pair in  years.i bought my airpod nd gen directly from apple (not on amazon).  my first pair had the microphones go out, but i did not realize it until just after the  month warranty expired.  i just thought siri sucked and could not figure out what i was asking.  had i realized it was a microphone issue in time, i would have been under warranty.  however, when i finally realized the microphones fully quit working, they would not replace them (days past warranty).  soon after this the speakers on one side started going out.  i had to adjust the iphone sound settings to have less sound go to one ear so they balanced out and then up the volume.  at this point i decided i would get a new pair because i use them all the time and need sound and microphones working.so, i bought a second pair.  fast forward several months and the microphones quit working on this pair.  this time i call for warranty asap.  they checked things over with me and replaced them.  to apple is credit, it was single day shipping and quick turnaround.so, onto my third pair.  about - months in with my third pair, the microphones quit working.  wth.  i am so careful with these things and have no clue how or why this could possibly be happening.  i was so busy working at the time i waited to contact support (thought the new pair would have typical  year functional warranty expectations).  well i was wrong there.  spent a long time with apple support and learned that the replacements are only covered for the remainder of your original pairs warranty (or  days if your previous pair were under that time remaining).  so, they only guarantee the replacements will function properly for the time remaining on your previous product warranty?  i get that they do not want people seeking a brand new product every year through minor warranty claims, but what if the replacement product legit fails in a short period of time?after being escalated to senior support staff at apple and some more discussions, they ultimately agreed to make an exception and provide me a warranty replacement pair.  sent them in and they confirmed the issue and replaced quickly.  again, quick turnaround with warranty shipping.so, onto my fourth pair.  everything works great, but it is only been a few days.i love the airpods.  they sound great.  i prefer earbuds that do not ""plug"" my ear and these fit my ears well.  only real issues have been those mentioned above.  another issue has been battery life.  it is great when they are newer.  normally, they notify you when they are running low several times before powering off.  as they get older, i will get that low battery sound and then they immediately shut down.the airpods have amazing reviews and ratings by thousands, so i am shocked i cannot find anyone else having issues with microphones like i am.  they are great when they work, but i have had tough luck getting them to work correctly for more than a year.update on th pair multistop  less than  months into the th pair and people were occasionally having trouble hearing me in conversations.  i isolated the left vs right mic in the settings and figured out the the right airpod microphone is going out (distant soft sound and cutting in and out).  did not notice earlier because the left still works fine and it must autoselect that mic most of the time.  called apple and looks like i am still in the  day warranty on replaced items (thankfully i caught it in time), so it looks like i may be able to get the right one replaced.  will have to again send the entire case and both airpods into their service center first to have them checked.i put these in my ears.  i put them back in the case.  i really do not understand how each pair could keep having this issue.",negative,star although amazing th pair yearsi bought airpod nd gen directly amazon first pair microphone go realize month warranty expired thought siri sucked could figure asking realized microphone issue time would warranty however finally realized microphone fully quit working would replace day past warranty soon speaker side started going adjust iphone sound setting le sound go ear balanced volume point decided would get new pair use time need sound microphone workingso bought second pair fast forward several month microphone quit working pair time call warranty asap checked thing replaced credit single day shipping quick turnaroundso onto third pair month third pair microphone quit working wth careful thing clue could possibly happening busy working time waited contact support thought new pair would typical year functional warranty expectation well wrong spent long time support learned replacement covered remainder original pair warranty day previous pair time remaining guarantee replacement function properly time remaining previous product warranty get want people seeking brand new product every year minor warranty claim replacement product legit fails short period timeafter escalated senior support staff discussion ultimately agreed make exception provide warranty replacement pair sent confirmed issue replaced quickly quick turnaround warranty shippingso onto fourth pair everything work great daysi sound great prefer earbuds plug ear fit ear well real issue mentioned another issue battery life great newer normally notify running low several time powering get older get low battery sound immediately shut downthe amazing review rating thousand shocked find anyone else issue microphone like great work tough luck getting work correctly yearupdate th pair multistop le month th pair people occasionally trouble hearing conversation isolated v mic setting figured airpod microphone going distant soft sound cutting notice earlier still work fine must autoselect mic time called look like still day warranty replaced item thankfully caught time look like may able get replaced send entire case service center first checkedi put ear put back case really understand pair could keep issue

"airpods are definitely very convenient to use, especially if you like to listen to music or videos while youre working/moving around. sound quality is standard and pretty much the same as the wired earbuds. the battery life is really good and you could listen for the entire day relatively uninterrupted if you use one airpod and swap when the battery runs low. even when i do not use them for several days, the battery doesnt drain so they can last a long while if you leave them around. however, theres a frustrating issue that ive encountered more times than should be acceptable for rather highly priced earbuds. this is mostly relevant if you tend to only use one earbud at a time though; its not a major issue if you normally use both at the same time.the first pair i ordered came brand new and sealed, but within a few hours, they had already stopped working properly. the right airpod would not connect unless the left was also in use. troubleshooting guides suggested resetting the airpods, reconnecting, testing on other devices, and etc., but nothing fixed the issue, and it was consistent throughout multiple devices (iphone, ipad, pc). i ended up returning these and requesting a replacement.the second pair i received, which is the one i currently own, worked fine for the first couple weeks. however, the issue from the previous pair started occurring with these as well. i decided to keep these despite the problem because unlike the first set, these seemed to function properly at least sometimes, so they werent consistently dysfunctional. resetting the airpods also temporarily resolves the issue, but this isnt the most convenient thing to do when it . happens rather frequently (pretty much daily) and . i have a case, and you need to hold onto the button on the back of the charging case to reset/reconnect. also, weirdly enough, this pair had the connection issues with both airpods. sometimes the right wouldnt work without the left, and other times the left wouldnt work without the right. its probably a weird coincidence, but it always seems like the one i want to use at any given moment is the earbud that doesnt want to connect without the other.anyway, i kept the second pair because they were functioning well enough, and i had purchased them for $ which i guess isnt too awful for brand new and legitimate apple airpods. but if the price was higher and i knew about this connectivity issue, which seems to be rather common judging from all the troubleshooting forums i found, i probably wouldnt make the purchase.",negative,definitely convenient use especially like listen music video youre workingmoving around sound quality standard pretty much wired earbuds battery life really good could listen entire day relatively uninterrupted use airpod swap battery run low even use several day battery doesnt drain last long leave around however there frustrating issue ive encountered time acceptable rather highly priced earbuds mostly relevant tend use earbud time though major issue normally use timethe first pair ordered came brand new sealed within hour already stopped working properly airpod would connect unless also use troubleshooting guide suggested resetting reconnecting testing device etc nothing fixed issue consistent throughout multiple device iphone ipad pc ended returning requesting replacementthe second pair received currently worked fine first couple week however issue previous pair started occurring well decided keep despite problem unlike first set seemed function properly least sometimes werent consistently dysfunctional resetting also temporarily resolve issue isnt convenient thing happens rather frequently pretty much daily case need hold onto button back charging case resetreconnect also weirdly enough pair connection issue sometimes wouldnt work without time wouldnt work without probably weird coincidence always seems like want use given moment earbud doesnt want connect without otheranyway kept second pair functioning well enough purchased guess isnt awful brand new legitimate price higher knew connectivity issue seems rather common judging troubleshooting forum found probably wouldnt make purchase

"i am fully in the apple ecosystem: iphone, ipad, mac. it was time to replace my wireless headphones and heard so much about the airpods and so many friends love them, decided to stay apple.  indeed airpods work great with apple products. if that is all you are going to use them for, do not hesitate. i have bought and returned  other airbud products. primary issue was the device staying in the ear, then sound quality.  airpods stay in your ears and the sound is very good for the price point.however multistop i am primarily interested in wireless help with hearing especially my tvs.  i do not have apple tv. one tv is a smart samsung with bluetooth and the other is panasonic that i have added a bluetooth transmitter.  anything that is not apple has no issue pairing with the tvs.  when it comes to pairing the airpods, my blood pressure rises each time. sometimes they pair, sometimes not.  but that is not the real issue.  the airpods do not have independent sound control. if you are using an apple device, you control the sound through the device like phone, watch etc.  however, my tvs (two major brands) do not have volume control for output. very few tvs do.  so if the volume is too high or too low, i need to disconnect from the tv, pair with an apple device, get the volume where i think i want it, then disconnect, then re-pair with the tv and hope the volume is somewhere near where i like it.i spoke with apple about this and their response is buy an apple tv device. that way the airpod will pair and sound can be controlled. in my case, i would need to buy  apple tv devices.  the low priced airbuds come with volume control, apparently there is not any technology magic required.  apple is choosing to not include.i am still undecided about returning the airpods. the fit, comfort and sound are well worth the price. the volume annoyance is a reminder each time i use these things that apple is not the customer focused/design company we think they are.  before i bought the airpods, i spoke with  friends who use and highly recommend.  each one told me i would be able to control the volume with my iphone or ipad. after talking with apple, that is not the case.while on that subject, since my last apple purchase this is the first time in about  months that i have needed to talk with apple support.  what has happened over there?  four calls in two weeks; each time i feel like i am speaking with someone that is just reading a script and does not really understand the issue.  the solution to most any issue seems to be, buy something else apple.  as a long time shareholder who is gone through a lot of stock splits, i appreciate the focus on apple products but come on, there is more solutions to improving an apple product than buying another apple product.",negative,fully ecosystem iphone ipad mac time replace wireless headphone heard much many friend decided stay indeed work great product going use hesitate bought returned airbud product primary issue device staying ear sound quality stay ear sound good price pointhowever multistop primarily interested wireless help hearing especially tv tv tv smart samsung bluetooth panasonic added bluetooth transmitter anything issue pairing tv come pairing blood pressure rise time sometimes pair sometimes real issue independent sound control using device control sound device like phone watch etc however tv two major brand volume control output tv volume high low need disconnect tv pair device get volume think want disconnect repair tv hope volume somewhere near like iti spoke response buy tv device way airpod pair sound controlled case would need buy tv device low priced airbuds come volume control apparently technology magic required choosing includei still undecided returning fit comfort sound well worth price volume annoyance reminder time use thing customer focuseddesign company think bought spoke friend use highly recommend told would able control volume iphone ipad talking casewhile subject since last purchase first time month needed talk support happened four call two week time feel like speaking someone reading script really understand issue solution issue seems buy something else long time shareholder gone lot stock split appreciate focus product come solution improving product buying another product
