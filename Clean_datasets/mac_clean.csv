positive,"great battery life, great performance! update //: i bought parallels desktop and a windows  license. i need it to try a certain amount of things in it, however, the performance when running windows in a virtualized environment (like parallels is) it gets seriously affected on the m, something that did not happen with intel processors. you notice the performance degrading (but not that much, maybe , or even % i risk to say) when switching between full screens and main desktop with windows (full separate screen, remember that there is an option to seamlessly integrate within your macos). you kinda feel the stutter but i can see the m processor get in the way and prioritize the screen, and that is a good thing to re-prioritize tasks that are being done in one screen or another (take the word ""screen"" as full-screen apps or software that switches between desktop and full-screen apps or between apps). in my case, running windows  makes the mbp m run hotter than i am really use to, but it does not affect battery performance as much as i expected! multistop  weird, is not it? multistop  love it!if you are going to virtualize something, that is not windows, you should not worry that much on this laptop. just remember that is still have gb ram and usable gb, therefore, performance would not be the same as bare metal.still, other regular software from apple or safari (or any other browser), office, adobe xd, photoshop do not affect performance nor consume that much battery, although if you are a graphic designer or a photographer making a quick change could make you brighten your screen, in which may lead to higher power consumption, which also could be confused by software running.one bad thing that i found with heavy usage is that the keyboard gets ""oily"", meaning, it wears in time and amount of usage per day; funny enough, the aluminum part of the palm rest do not have any signs of wear.another thing that i found is that the left speaker sounds like it broke when hearing at % volume, i do not know if that is fixable or not, anywho anyhow multistop  i am gonna stick with that because i rarely use it.one thing that i have also found is how i got used to the fact that this mbp m takes nothing to return from suspended state, why? because no matter what other laptop i use (or desktop, for that matter), all of them takes a few seconds to access to their respective desktops and another few seconds to actually be productive (after booting software) multistop  this one literally takes nothing to wake and start using it multistop  that is why i am not changing this laptop multistop  and yes, even with its flaws multistop  why? because in critical cases when i need to go somewhere and fast react to do something at work, i just do it! it takes me  seconds to wake up the mbp and enter another desktop via anydesk or teamviewer or ssh multistop  this takes time on most windows laptops multistop  i love it!i just wish this laptop was upgradeable multistop  after all at the end of the day, it makes my life so useful and convenient despite the down side of it multistop  what a masterpiece! i just wish i could do more and more with it, i feel limited multistop  but happy!and by the way, i still stand on my original review.original: i believe i have found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! although i do not use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, apple made the macos more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.user experience on the macos is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it does not feel like home, the new normal is not good so far.keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there is the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you are watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you are on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you cannot with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!i know (and i am very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software multistop  but that is not the end-game, the thing is that we should not need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over  years!speed on this macbook: you do not even feel it multistop  everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it is most likely the software or the website you are on, is that simple! if you are planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that is guaranteed.i have not used it on games because that is why i have my pc and xbox for. however, if you are planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd is) of storage, if that is gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.weight is not a problem, it makes you feel like you are having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. construction feels like you own something premium and well-made.",battery life performance update bought parallel desktop window license need try certain amount thing however performance running window virtualized environment like parallel get seriously affected something happen intel processor notice performance degrading much maybe even risk say switching full screen main desktop window full separate screen remember option seamlessly integrate within macos kinda feel stutter see processor get way prioritize screen good thing reprioritize task done one screen another take word screen fullscreen apps software switch desktop fullscreen apps apps case running window make mbp run hotter really use affect battery performance much expected multistop weird multistop love itif going virtualize something window worry much remember still gb ram usable gb therefore performance would bare metalstill regular software safari browser office adobe xd photoshop affect performance consume much battery although graphic designer photographer making quick change could make brighten screen may lead higher power consumption also could confused software runningone bad thing found heavy usage keyboard get oily meaning wear time amount usage per day funny enough aluminum part palm rest sign wearanother thing found left speaker sound like broke hearing volume know fixable anywho anyhow multistop gon na stick rarely use itone thing also found got used fact mbp take nothing return suspended state matter use desktop matter take second access respective desktop another second actually productive booting software multistop one literally take nothing wake start using multistop changing multistop yes even flaw multistop critical case need go somewhere fast react something work take second wake mbp enter another desktop via anydesk teamviewer ssh multistop take time window laptop multistop love iti wish upgradeable multistop end day make life useful convenient despite side multistop masterpiece wish could feel limited multistop happyand way still stand original revieworiginal believe found unicorn particular still last insane amount time although use full brightness regulate lot connecting several device via bluetooth transparent unfortunately made macos inconvenient handle term simplicityuser experience macos weird know user thing used relearn thing feel like home new normal good farkeyboard relatively quiet also missing keyboard light iteration take probably useful key u watching movie literally stop movie go menu turn keyboard light presentation everything dark turn screen light keyboard need actually stop paying attention presentation go menu inconvenient hecki know well aware workarounds change keyboard light using small software multistop endgame thing need extra software aditional configuration use something literally yearsspeed even feel multistop everything instant nothing slow something likely software website simple planning using massive storage use usbc one usba usbc dongle bottleneck guaranteedi used game xbox however planning developing software make sure library fit within gb half recommended ssd storage gon na issue go usbc massive storageweight problem make feel like premium hand enough make bag heavier construction feel like something premium wellmade
positive,"very lightweight, good speed, but not gold at all updated review with more detail [after  weeks]. ** see additional note re color.i switched to mac  years ago, and for that entire period, i had the same laptop, a macbook pro, late- model. after the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. i used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. i have never gamed on my  laptop. of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. so, i finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this  macbook air.general features: switching from a pro to an air model is weird at first because the air is so thin and lightweight. it has an extremely slim profile. i have to be extra careful when i grab the laptop to move to another room. like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. i did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but i took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. the macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. let is hope it does not drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. my older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it is corner or edge in  years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. but the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but i quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. the only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, lcd, or anything else. i do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.battery: upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and i decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around -%. i was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. keeping that limited use in mind, i did not need to charge it for maybe  week. great battery life thus far. i will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current os, higher ram, and m chip, especially because i connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.speed/ports/bluetooth: compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. i already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so i purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a usb hub in advance to take care of that issue. so far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my thunderbolt display monitor. the bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than i expected. the bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.charger:  ** in my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. they attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. easy and convenient. the mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. this is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. it is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. however, there is no indicator light, so you cannot tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. you cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. you have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. big bummer. **miscellaneous features: my previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. after some additional research, i realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. big bummer. there is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop and logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but will not show you the percentage until you log in. not ideal at all.-------quick review for recently purchased product [during black friday]. i will update with a more detailed review once i have used it for a longer period.***** important note: if you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" do not get it. i had a silver macbook pro for many years, and i went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. i would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. definitely not the look i wanted to have, and i regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as i keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' it would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store.",lightweight good speed gold updated review detail week see

positive,"great notebook with almost no weaknesses why is it that the pc world cannot make a good notebook for the same price? the macbook air is the bar that every pc model should be at. i bought a pc notebook that has seen more time at the repair depot than in my use. i finally decided to buy a macbook air because i was so impressed with a mac mini i bought. i like everything about the air from the keyboard, touchpad, beautiful screen quality and study chassis. i was skeptical of the finless design having had intel macbook airs that ran very warm. so far this apple silicon macbook has stayed cool to touch. honestly, i think a m macbook is all many really need for general use cases. i highly recommend a macbook air over any pc notebook.",notebook almost weakness world make good notebook price bar every model bought notebook seen time repair depot use finally decided buy impressed mini bought like everything keyboard touchpad beautiful screen quality study chassis skeptical finless design intel air ran warm far silicon stayed cool touch honestly think many really need general use case highly recommend notebook

positive,"finally able to move to a mac i have tried for years to move to a mac given in use an iphone and ipad, however, the office apps in the past were somewhat quirky on a mac.  so finally, they pretty much work the same as on my windows pc with a few exceptions, but for the most part i cant tell a big difference.the mac hardware and os is way superior to a windows laptop in this price range.  im primarily a business user and the office suite is what im in daily so now that its very similar to the windows os version, i do not see myself going back to windows.",finally able move tried year move given use iphone ipad however office apps past somewhat quirky finally pretty much work window exception part cant tell big differencethe hardware o way superior window price range im primarily business user office suite im daily similar window o version see going back window
positive,"love apple but this is disappointing multistop  im a big apple fan. i usually use macbook pros for work. i decided to get the air for the days when i do not need the pro with me. i like the size and the weight, but there are little glitches here and there that are just very annoying to me. photos cant crop more than two pictures at the time without glitches. i do the same on the pro, no problem. this is easy work and has nothing to do with how powerful your computer is. im talking about cropping regular phone size pics for social media. no filters or animations or anything like this. it cant do that.sometimes when you try to write a post on social media, the space bar moves cursor up as an arrow, rather than a space, usually when you get to the second paragraph of your post. i havent noticed this in pages, just social media. these are small things but when youre in a hurry, they can be very annoying. the button to change languages is very temperamental, sometimes works, sometimes doesnt. if youre trying to write a social media post in two different languages, good luck. you have to select outside of the post pop-up in order to change your language every single time. and idk, it might be just mine that is doing this, but its making me stay away from everything air.as far as amazon shipment, delivery and so on, no complains. everything was as expected for this item.",love disappointing multistop im big fan usually use pro work decided get day need pro like size weight little glitch annoying photo cant crop two picture time without glitch pro problem easy work nothing powerful im talking cropping regular phone size pic social medium filter animation anything like cant thatsometimes try write post social medium space bar move cursor arrow rather space usually get second paragraph post havent noticed page social medium small thing youre hurry annoying button change language temperamental sometimes work sometimes doesnt youre trying write social medium post two different language good luck select outside post popup order change language every single time idk might mine making stay away everything airas far amazon shipment delivery complains everything expected item

positive,"awesome notebook computer! i have two macbook airs (mba), a "" and a , both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, x resolution) and this new "" mba improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.good:- screen looks great!  x resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  i usually do not go above % brightness.- keyboard is good.  some have mentioned that it still sucks, but i find it much better than the older mbas that i own and better than say, the magic keyboard.  even with a thin silicone keyboard cover i find the typing experience to be much better and i can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- battery life is fantastic.  have not done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, hd vs k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on youtube, accessing vpn for work (citrix, epic), etc., it has been great.  easily tops  hours and super impressed so far.- looks great.  love the newer (i know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- no fan.  that is awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- performance.  it works great so far on what i have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using apple silicon for the first time.  for just day to day use and things like chrome, office (word, excel), citirx, epic, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with -core gpu.  also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the m versus my  imac "" (top end) with intel chips.- touch id is great still.  works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iphone home buttons.  on the other hand, it should really have face id at this point.- apple ecosystem is great as usual and a real reason to get this mba.  apple watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need face id if you have the watch).  you can easily send/receive files using airdrop or cast using airplay.  and so on and so forth.- big sur comes preinstalled but you need to update to get  multistop not good:- webcam still sucks.  still low resolution and just does not look good in facetime, teams, etc.  shame that apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the macs (the "" imac finally upgraded to p front cams only a couple months ago multistop  i got one and it looks so much better than this mba is camera).- only  ports.  sad that this thing has only  usb-c ports (that cover thunderbolt , usb ., charging, displayport).  given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one usb-c port for other use, pretty lame.  i wish they had squeezed (i think it would fit) a usb-a port so that i could plug in my wireless mouse usb-a dongle as i have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more usb-c port.- new tech (apple silicon) means the m-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. photoshop still not available at release.- battery still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  easier to have an iphone is battery replaced than a mba i would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for  years at the minimum.overall:a few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this mba is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the apple ecosystem.

positive,"outstanding i bought this  macbook air ( gb ram,  gb ssd storage) to replace a  macbook air (gb ram,  gb ssd storage).  i am undeniably a fan of apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old macbook air is more than  years old and still working perfectly).  although i have been underwhelmed by some mac models in recent years, this one is stellar imho.  unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.the m processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  battery life is every bit as good as advertised; i can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  connecting usb devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that is to be expected.  i love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the m chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  in use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for apple processors (as macos big sur is).  interestingly, microsoft has been on board early with m optimization; the latest office  version is smooth and fast on this machine.  i also tried out ms edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it is my current default browser.  the touch id and apple pay capability is a welcome addition.the only cons i see are minor in my opinion.  because ram is integrated into the m processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you will need  gb of memory that model can be had from the apple store.  there has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  for me that is not insurmountable; i simply use a usb-c hub to provide additional connectivity.  i have read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their m macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  to be on the safe side i use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  for example, i saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has no usb ports multiexclamation "", which is patently false.  in fact, its two ports are both usb, they just require a different connector.  what these users are looking for is the old usb-a connectors, which this macbook does not have; however, that is easily fixed by using a usb-a to usb-c converter cable, or with a usb-c hub.  usb-a peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.all things considered, i really love this machine.  the $ price (at the time i bought mine) was $ less than i would have paid at the apple store, and i believe i can probably get $ on ebay for my old macbook air (try that with a -year-old pc!) leaving me with a total outlay of $.  considering that i will almost certainly get  or more years use out of this model, i'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",outstanding bought gb ram gb ssd storage replace gb ram gb ssd storage undeniably fan product general work little fuss built last note old year old still working perfectly although underwhelmed model recent year one stellar imho unless heavy system requirement machine would excellent choicethe processor impressive delivering outstanding performance powerthermal efficiency simultaneously battery life every bit good advertised charge overnight use day without plugging connecting usb device external drive shorten battery life expected love fanless design mean machine absolutely silent time thermal efficiency chip allows remain amazingly cool use feel fast especially apps optimized processor macos big sur interestingly microsoft board early optimization latest office version smooth fast machine also tried m edge new based recommendation another user pleased speed efficiency current default browser touch id pay capability welcome additionthe con see minor opinion ram integrated processor postpurchase memory expansion possible think need gb memory model store criticism fact machine two port fair insurmountable simply use usbc hub provide additional connectivity read recently user certain hub cause problem mac appears related battery charging hub safe side use builtin port charging issuesreading relative handful critical review look like excluding actual defect happen product based lack understanding example saw large number review complaining machine usb port multiexclamation patently false fact two port usb require different connector user looking old usba connector however easily fixed using usba usbc converter cable usbc hub usba peripheral gradually disappearing well favor new connectorall thing considered really love machine price time bought mine le would paid store believe probably get ebay old try yearold leaving total outlay considering almost certainly get year use model im happy purchase would

positive,"love this notebook! i recently migrated to apple after many years using a wide variety of pcs running windows or linux. i decided to make that move after apple is introduction of the m processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. now. of course, the m has been released, but, depending on your needs, the  macbook air with the m will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. you can search the internet for professional reviews of the macbook air, but i feel confident you will find plenty to verify what i'm saying.the retina display is beautiful. the sound system is superior to any other laptop i have owned or used. the battery holds up all day under typical use, and i can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. the apple os (monterey) is smooth and fast, and i was able to learn my way around in it quickly. when you need help, a google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of apple support.i will say that the air is a little short on usb ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. however, i have run a usb hub from one of the two thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers multistop even a portable dvd-burner. as far as a touchscreen goes, i have that on a dell laptop i run linux on, but i never use it multistop guess i'm a mouse or touchpad guy.the aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the air is light at under  lbs.one last thing! i have been a heavy user of both google and microsoft services, and i have found that apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the mac environment. i run google is backup and sync and microsoft is onedrive with no problems. my avg subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both mac os and windows machines.i have no regrets for this purchase. actually, the air was my rd m mac. i also have an imac and a mac mini. they all work together very well!",love notebook recently migrated many year using wide variety pc running window linux decided make move introduction processor proven excellent hardware platform course released depending need save money still delivering outstanding performance attractively perfectly manufactured hardware search internet professional review feel confident find plenty verify im sayingthe retina display beautiful sound system superior owned used battery hold day typical use verify battery hold charge well least week notebook powered o monterey smooth fast able learn way around quickly need help google search yield ton tip quickly avail supporti say little short usb port lack builtin card slot course equipped touchscreen however run usb hub one two thunderbolt port seems enough power support flash drive card reader multistop even portable dvdburner far touchscreen go dell run linux never use multistop guess im mouse touchpad guythe aluminum housing beautifully machined finished keyboard nice touch battery seems charge quickly light lbsone last thing heavy user google microsoft service found provides ample support integrating service environment run google backup sync microsoft onedrive problem avg subscription allows use antivirus software o window machinesi regret purchase actually rd also imac mini work together well

positive,"over to the darkside update:i saw some reviews that said their rd party usb hub broke their mac. i have been using a usb-c to usb-a for a few weeks now with no problems (made by uni). it is worked for everything i threw at it; logitech g keyboard, razor mouse, yamaha digital piano, rme audio interface, roland a- midi keyboard. they all worked. i also have a cheapo amazon basics single usb adaptor cord about "" long, and it too works with everything on the macbook.after decades of looking through bill gates' windows, i bought my first mac but only because of the new m chip, where everything is on this one chip, which makes it faster. applications optimized for the m now rival high end pcs (and for the first time too). i never was interested in macs because they were overpriced and underpowered, but it looks like that worm has turned. just do not buy an earlier version of macs, especially with intel chips.keep in mind when/if you buy this, there are no upgrades later on; zero, nada, nothing to change out. you cannot add ram nor storage once it is built. (there is a workaround on storage, by adding an external ssd drive, but as i understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive, but that may change over time.)also, ssd storage, while blazingly fast and so worth it, need about % 'headroom.' that is for example, if you have gb storage, you can only use gb as you need a % reserve to account for ssds getting used up. it is the nature of the beast. and of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one. for my pc i bought a gb ssd and found that it was maxing out pretty fast, so i replaced with a tb ssd and have already filled up half of it, but i do not expect to fill it up completely anytime soon. it should be good for maybe a decade or so.so bottom line, get at least the gb storage or you will be sorry. it does kind of suck that apple charges so much for each step increase in storage, but paying the extra $ in this case is worth it, imho. the jury is still out on if you need bg of ram vs the gb models currently in stock, (apple treats it like a custom order at this time, with a waiting period.)  if it was a pc, then getting gb ram is a no-brainer, but in the case of the m chip, it shares memory within the chip, making the most use of it. i have gb in my pc because ram sticks are relatively cheap.remember, once you buy a macbook, it will stay as is. upgrades are impossible (which has always been the case for notebooks anyway).",darkside updatei saw review said rd party usb hub broke using usbc usba week problem made uni worked everything threw logitech g keyboard razor mouse yamaha digital piano rme audio interface roland midi keyboard worked also cheapo amazon basic single usb adaptor cord long work everything macbookafter decade looking bill gate window bought first new chip everything one chip make faster application optimized rival high end pc first time never interested mac overpriced underpowered look like worm turned buy earlier version mac especially intel chipskeep mind whenif buy upgrade later zero nada nothing change add ram storage built workaround storage adding external ssd drive understand problem viewing external drive may change timealso ssd storage blazingly fast worth need headroom example gb storage use gb need reserve account ssds getting used nature beast course preinstalled software also take storage space day one bought gb ssd found maxing pretty fast replaced tb ssd already filled half expect fill completely anytime soon good maybe decade soso bottom line get least gb storage sorry kind suck charge much step increase storage paying extra case worth imho jury still need bg ram v gb model currently stock treat like custom order time waiting period getting gb ram nobrainer case chip share memory within chip making use gb ram stick relatively cheapremember buy stay upgrade impossible always case notebook anyway

negative,"poor construction for long life of equipment.  flicker with k buying into the apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow.  they are too expensive for that.  apple just does not make good computers.  yes, they make a ok operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.you cannot just go and buy the parts to fix your mac computers when they break.  the macbook air is no exception to this.  the ssd is solider to the motherboard.  likewise the ram.  now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  but, they do not even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  so, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  needless to say, this is a major flaw in apple products -- of which it is no exception for this macbook air.  (oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)also, this computer flickers with a k output.  the macbook air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the hootoo dock that i have used with an intel macbook pro which is a few years old.  this is unacceptable.  apple is response to the sometimes frying the computer for using usb-c docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and ram.  it is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  if you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their intel mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (supposedly apple fix this with an os update -- good for them.)even though i dislike the mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  would i buy one again? perhaps -- it is a question of whether i think the market exists for me to make money off of it.the good things:keyboard, touchpad, built-in screen, build-in speakers, drives external audio better than microsoft windows, and the operating system is less cluttered than is windows.  also, comes with a spreadsheet, word processor, presentation program -- now, it is better just to use something really libre -- like libreoffice.  but, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for microsoft windows.",poor construction long life equipment flicker k buying ecosystem done make product ecosystem make user money make critical part workflow expensive make good computer yes make ok operating system make computer repaired taking ssd ram stick putting new one inyou go buy part fix computer break exception ssd solider motherboard likewise ram problem well one would able get someone skilled replace broken piece stop warranty coverage maybe even allow supplier chip supply public warranty able get spare part needle say major flaw product exception oh start allowing supplier supply lock crypto key particular machine even ewastealso flicker k output screen flicker external monitor using hootoo dock used intel pro year old unacceptable response sometimes frying using usbc dock work computer example poorly built pushingthough poorly engineered term video ssd ram wonderful typing experience using keyboard willing let guide may worth willing set aside another grand ssd fails plug wrong dock drive external monitor even though someone else intel plugged worked fine supposedly fix o update good themeven though dislike better laptop quiet since fan would buy one perhaps question whether think market exists make money itthe good thingskeyboard touchpad builtin screen buildin speaker drive external audio better microsoft window operating system le cluttered window also come spreadsheet word processor presentation program better use something really libre like libreoffice kind nice table steak included unlike microsoft window

positive,"it was a great product! through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. from my personal experience i believe that the macbook air  is the best tool for the job. if you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the macbook air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses.first, the macbook air  is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged. in my school days i did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. now i do not have to do that at all because i only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its  hour charge. next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including apple music, imessage, facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. this apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. finally, is the processing speed and storage. the macbook air  has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. this makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. although it is expensive, the macbook air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the macbooks, including computers such as the macbook pro. the strange thing that the macbook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. the storage that is available with the macbook is gb, gb, tb, or tb, but most went with gb. these large amounts of storage are fantastic, showing that one of the macbook air is biggest competitors(dell xps ) only lets you choose between gb and gb. now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just will not cut it. for these reasons the macbook air  is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility.overall, the mackbook air has the processing speed, storage capacity, battery life, and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer. throughout the last year and a half, i have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things. getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker, but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience.",product past year half student use personal computer laptop everyday task importantly school personal experience believe best tool job plan frequently use personal future right choice processing speed storage ability keep charge compatibility usesfirst amazingly convenient use throughout day ability hold charge quickly get charged school day much time worry battery life need charge twice week hour charge next compatibility us including music imessage facetime etc make product easy use use multiple device action getting photo photo getting one picture text compatibility let see thing worry changing device finally processing speed storage processor considered gaming running large application within make amazingly fast average school work using everyday life although expensive considered best price macbooks including computer pro strange thing amazing showing slim appearance lightweight feel storage available gb gb tb tb went gb large amount storage fantastic showing one biggest competitorsdell xps let choose gb gb want large amount picture apps kind storage cut reason best choice daily use school work processing speed storage ability keep charge compatibilityoverall mackbook processing speed storage capacity battery life compatibility make best choice personal throughout last year half lot school work many thing getting helped quicker improved quality work nice layout convenience

positive,"the macbook is great! macbook review apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the mac is no exception. i have had different laptops before highschool, like chromebooks, so i knew what i liked and did not like. after about two months of searching, i landed on the macbook.  when researching which laptop to buy for highschool, i landed upon the macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the macbook, like touch i.d. and siri. the modern aspects of the macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. the first one is fingerprint recognition. when i had old laptops, i always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. now, however, apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which i find extremely useful. between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. now, though, all i need is my fingerprint and i can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. also, the macbook comes with siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the mac. there are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. but, siri makes it easier. to activate siri, all you have to do is simply say hey, siri and the assistant will appear. siri responds to what is said, so if i say, hey siri, find review  from google drive, the document will appear seconds later. although the modern technologies of the macbook are important, just as important is the software. many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to apples macbook. first, the mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. safari is the macs main browser, so what happens if for some reason i need to use google chrome? well, the mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, google chrome, safari, and bing. also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. most laptops are meant for business or school, like the macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the mac for games. sometimes, after school, i explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. i expected the macbook to do somewhat poorly, but i thought that it actually did pretty well. another reason why the macbook is great is because of the battery. the batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. the macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a chromebook. when i first used my macbook, i used it without charging it until it needed it. how long did it last after starting at %? almost one day with no charge. the chromebook i had when i was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. also, the battery uses an optimizing system. when the battery is below %, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. this helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop i have had. the macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. from the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. the mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever.",review created many technological wonder throughout time business exception different laptop highschool like chromebooks knew liked like two month searching landed researching buy highschool landed upon reliable battery software modern feature brought like touch id siri modern aspect beyond serve many purpose laptop fail incorporate first one fingerprint recognition old laptop always remember every character password plain hassle however fingerprint scanner built find extremely useful school password home password important information lot keep track though need fingerprint get account fingerprint also come siri virtual assistant task find different file many different paper file website needed keep track finding efficiently almost impossible siri make easier activate siri simply say hey siri assistant appear siri responds said say hey siri find review google drive document appear second later although modern technology important important software many laptop lack software highend desktop would apply apple first capability gaming desktop computer safari mac main browser happens reason need use google chrome well ability run two three different utility google chrome safari bing also software allows also play desktop game want laptop meant business school like perform well game sometimes school explore test limit get sense max expected somewhat poorly thought actually pretty well another reason battery battery every seem looked indepth battery equal long battery life compared another like chromebook first used used without charging needed long last starting almost one day charge chromebook middle school would need charged five hour use also battery us optimizing system battery system turn battery power done thus turn brightness screen help maintain battery longer period time battery many reason best modern efficient student kind people battery life software modern feature use matter change get thing done view forever

positive,"the perfect laptop (for me, and maybe you) over the past  years, i have had five macbook airs and three macbook pros (my employer provides a new one for my work every few years, and i upgrade my own at home every - years).  most recently, my personal computer has been an early  intel quad core macbook pro and my work computer an early  macbook air.  the brand new m macbook air is my favorite by far, and fixes everything i did not like about the macbook air and pro introduced in early .the m mb air is battery life is amazing, i can use it all day and still have -% battery remaining.  my previous mb air and mb pro gave me around - hours of battery life (despite apple promising ~ hours) - which was barely enough to get me through the day.i'm also loving the the fanless design, silent operation, and increased performance.  even though i do not do much video editing, my workflow can be taxing on the computer:  i regularly run lots of apps simultaneously, including zoom for teaching, many open browser windows, excel and statistical/database software, and a connected ipad i use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over zoom.  the new m macbook air handles this easily, and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan.  the mb pro i have used since april (the one introduced in early  with intel quad core processors) also handles this load well, but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes.  the early  macbook air buckled under this load, it gets very hot and the fans are screaming.besides the better battery life, silent operation, and robust performance, the new m mb air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous mb airs.the mb air is display does not get as bright as the mb pro is display - that has been true for years, but it has never been a problem for me.  i would only need the display to be brighter if i were working outside on a sunny day, and i just do not do that.i really love the keyboard on the new m macbook air, which is the same as the keyboard on the early  mb air and pro, and much improved imho from the butterfly keyboards on the previous mb airs and pros.  it is quiet and super comfortable for typing.  when typing very fast, my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly-style keyboards.this is subjective, but i really prefer the mb air form factor - the wedge shape and slightly lower weight - compared to the mb pro.  i also strongly dislike the mb pro is touch bar.  i have had two different mb pros with touch bars and they were nothing but trouble for me.  when typing fast, my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the touch bar, which would trigger a command (like launching the music app), which would interrupt my workflow.  i know other people do not have that problem, and other people find the touch bar useful, but it is just not for me.for me, the mb air speakers (on this and on the previous model) are quite good for movies or youtube videos or zoom/facetime calls.  the microphone is perfectly satisfactory, though for zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos i usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better.the webcam is still disappointing, even though image quality is slightly improved over previous macbooks.the external design is exactly the same as macbook airs from years past.  i like the design pretty well, but apple will redesign the mb air and pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer.  i will want one of those and might regret that i did not wait.but for now, the m macbook air is the best macbook i have ever had, it fixes everything that i did not like about previous macbooks (except the webcam) and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way.",perfect maybe past year five air three pro employer provides new one work every year upgrade home every year recently personal early intel quad core pro work early brand new favorite far fix everything like pro introduced early mb battery life amazing use day still battery remaining previous mb mb pro gave around hour battery life despite promising hour barely enough get dayim also loving fanless design silent operation increased performance even though much video editing workflow taxing regularly run lot apps simultaneously including zoom teaching many open browser window excel statisticaldatabase software connected ipad use digital whiteboard teaching zoom new handle easily get hot despite lack fan mb pro used since april one introduced early intel quad core processor also handle load well get warmer fan kick sometimes early buckled load get hot fan screamingbesides better battery life silent operation robust performance new mb display better color slightly better webcam compared previous mb airsthe mb display get bright mb pro display true year never problem would need display brighter working outside sunny day thati really love keyboard new keyboard early mb pro much improved imho butterfly keyboard previous mb air pro quiet super comfortable typing typing fast accuracy higher keyboard butterflystyle keyboardsthis subjective really prefer mb form factor wedge shape slightly lower weight compared mb pro also strongly dislike mb pro touch bar two different mb pro touch bar nothing trouble typing fast finger would sometimes slightly graze edge touch bar would trigger command like launching music app would interrupt workflow know people problem people find touch bar useful mefor mb speaker previous model quite good movie youtube video zoomfacetime call microphone perfectly satisfactory though zoom call making instructional video usually plug cheap external mic little betterthe webcam still disappointing even though image quality slightly improved previous macbooksthe external design exactly air year past like design pretty well redesign mb pro next year reduce bezel allow bigger screen without increasing size want one might regret waitbut best ever fix everything like previous macbooks except webcam offer really computing experience every way

positive,"in many respects, surface better, but mac air with m has some advantages i have both an ipad and iphone so i thought is would be make sense to have a mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  to some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  i am coming from a surface pro .  the mac air is battery life is much less than advertised.  the claim is around  hours, i doubt i get , and i am mostly doing internet browsing and word stuff.  battery life from fully charged was about  hour while on zoom.  the battery life of the surface is better.  word for mac is a little different than word for a pc, but the differences are minor and manageable.  but documents open more slowly on the mac, and mine has the m chip.  on the surface, documents usually open immediately.  on the mac it might take  seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  the surface boots up much faster than the mac.  i have a dvd with a number of workouts on it.  i could not get any individual workouts to open using the mac is native software.  so i downloaded vlc.  it works fine on the mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  this seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the app store, including firefox.  there do not appear to be mac apps for either.  on the other hand, the mac has a better screen than the surface.  while the surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and i almost never use it as a tablet.  when i am not sitting at a desk, i prefer the mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a surface.  the new mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the surface.  so a mixed bag.  as i mentioned, i like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the mac.  i am mulling over upgrading to the macbook pro  because of its bigger battery, but do not know if i want to spend the extra money.",many respect surface better advantage ipad iphone thought would make sense everything one ecosystem extent indeed proved true useful coming surface pro battery life much le advertised claim around hour doubt get mostly internet browsing word stuff battery life fully charged hour zoom battery life surface better word little different word difference minor manageable document open slowly mine chip surface document usually open immediately might take second eternity little annoying surface boot much faster dvd number workout could get individual workout open using native software downloaded vlc work fine take long time open minute seems true software downloaded app store including firefox appear apps either hand better screen surface surface quite good marginal tablet almost never use tablet sitting desk prefer two part come apart happen surface new keyboard work maybe tie surface mixed bag mentioned like everything one ecosystem likely enough benefit keep mulling upgrading pro bigger battery know want spend extra money

i'm not so  sure about the price here. you can buy a mac pro  inch that is faster than an i for  (if you get gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it is not a lenovo, but other than that it is about as good as you can get. this machine is so well thought out. i got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you do not need that you can just get the air which does not have the horrible touch bar. do not get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine in addition to normal keys. that is where they went wrong here they got greedy. i digress. the only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. it needs ports on both sides and at least x ports.all these reviews are usually full of crap. it is just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. this time it is true. this architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. i 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc is not new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. i do not see any reason for the work i am doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc) multistop  i mean for a lot of system stuff i will still use i would still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. what a great product. it really really is. this i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. after  months of hell no more fumbeling around with tpm chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. i like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.this thing is really just that good. i have been i this industry for a long time. there are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. i have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. i would imagine there will be a strong response fro intel, amd and the software companies.  it is difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. i mean just get the air for , just get the extra ram. maybe  gb. that is all most people are going to need. who cares if they release better ones in  months. they always do they will probably cost too much. this is all you need.",really even fan love linux tolerate window usually like fine folk like like linux give choice extensible run fast even older hardware get infinite support get harassed use cortana siri candy crush itunes etc etc usually push hard echo system lot stuff really like used getting music itunes painwell mainly work linux day wanted unix style working remote needed something microsoft office need window development day know wsl trade offs window use case tried multistop gave another shot really timing seemingly really good fantastic know hate laptop degree melting nut sound like jet pack hate really laptop pleased report screw performance mean quiet note heat featurethis coming someone want like outsource job stuff priced right im sure price buy pro inch faster get gb battery amazing heat fan sound screen keyboard lenovo good get machine well thought got pro reason take lot call wanted slightly better sound boosted batterybut need get horrible touch bar get wrong touch bar would fine addition normal key went wrong got greedy digress issue see connectivity suck need port side least x portsall review usually full crap people getting free hardware writing review take tax deduction sort marketing time true architecture significant advance especially space sure translate desktop risc v cisc new going decade laptop quantum leap see reason work use desktop point complete portability take call amazing call work m office general development vscode jetbrains stuff docker etc multistop mean lot system stuff still use would still use linux work way go product really really strong endorsement give need productive month hell fumbeling around tpm chip mics able share screen pleading use right audio device like better ever farthis thing really good industry long time going change competitor product line continues maintain price point deliver product caliber question one going eat market share fast would imagine strong response fro intel amd software company difficult justify purchasing moment mean get get extra ram maybe gb people going need care release better one month always probably cost much need

positive,"fantastic laptop when i was in college, i used both mac and pc and after i graduated i switched exclusively to pc because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). when i decided to go back to grad school, i decided to give apple another chance with this laptop because i heard great things and high expectation with the new m chip design. i was not disappointed.this new cpu has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use (browsing the web, watching videos, reading, studying, etc. ). i can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it. also, it is so compact and thin that it is easy to take everywhere! compared to my old macbook from , it is incredibly light. i always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops, but this definitely is easy to carry around.as someone who used a desktop, the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to. the keys do not have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has, but considering the size of the laptop, it is expected. i can see it being an issue with its small screen. although it is convenient for me, the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight. lastly, the price is steep for a laptop. a pc variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where apple normally lacks, but i have yet to try the apple arcade on my macbook air. it is also only usb-c which is a turn-off to many, but with a dongle, it is not a problem for me.i would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with, this is an easy grab. make sure you buy a dongle along side of it.tl;drpros:- battery life- m chip- size (easy to carry around)- weightcons:- keyboard- size (screen is a bit small for some)- price- only usb-c",fantastic college used graduated switched exclusively versatility gaming upgradability decided go back grad school decided give another chance heard thing high expectation new chip design disappointedthis new cpu speed run fantastic daily moderate use browsing web watching video reading studying etc go cafe use day without charge also compact thin easy take everywhere compared old incredibly light always notion made heavy laptop definitely easy carry aroundas someone used desktop keyboard bit harder adapt key deep switch normal keyboard considering size expected see issue small screen although convenient size inconvenient hard sight lastly price steep variant money used buy gaming normally lack yet try arcade also usbc turnoff many dongle problem mei would say looking work study easy grab make sure buy dongle along side ittldrpros battery life chip size easy carry around weightcons keyboard size screen bit small price usbc

positive,"in love with my new macbook air! i'm new to macbooks, having used windows my whole life. i chose this for going back to school because i knew it would last longer and not get buggy like windows always does. while the transition was a bit rocky at first, now that i somewhat know what i'm doing, i absolutely love this computer! it is small and lightweight, but still feel solid in your hands. the processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time. i can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds (literally, no joke!), something i could never do with a windows laptop (i should mention that i bought my computer directly from apple and upgraded to the bg ram and more storage, which helps immensely with load up time). for those that say the camera is bad- i do not think so. is it the most amazing camera ever? no, but if you really need higher camera quality for your job, then you should probably go with a macbook pro instead of air. for a zoom meeting it works just fine. the price is obviously higher than many laptops- that is why i have never used mac until now- but just think of it as an investment. i know i will be able to use this for years to come!if you are looking for an efficient, reliable laptop with great performance, look no further!",love new im new macbooks used window whole life chose going back school knew would last longer get buggy like window always transition bit rocky first somewhat know im absolutely love small lightweight still feel solid hand processor incredibly fast well load time get signed note second literally joke something could never window mention bought directly upgraded bg ram storage help immensely load time say camera bad think amazing camera ever really need higher camera quality job probably go pro instead zoom meeting work fine price obviously higher many laptop never used think investment know able use year comeif looking efficient reliable performance look

positive,"i have never been happier with any other laptop! i was hesitant to get a smaller macbook after my ""  macbook pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  i repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.anyhow, i could not resist the idea of an arm based macbook, so i went with the  "" macbook air since i do not think the pro model had apple silicon yet.  i could be wrong on that.long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  it turns out that i'm perfectly comfortable with a "" screen and that i do not need a bigger one.everything great about this macbook:- it is *fast*!  do not let the ""air"" moniker deceive you.  unless you are into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  arm processors are the future of consumer computing.- the battery life is *insane*.  i still cannot comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  i take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that i will run out of power, even when i'm charging my phone off it!- it is slim and light!  perfect for traveling.- it is completely solid state with no moving parts!  no fan whirring or anything like that.- as an extension of the first point, it runs arm builds of windows insanely well with parallels.  it can even run halo: ce at near full speed!- macos is very stable.- the retina screen is nice.- despite what people are saying about the camera, it is actually better than the one on my old macbook pro.  (this is not to say that the camera is *good*, but it is adequate imo)- all things considered, the m macbook air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- it has a larger touchpad than my old macbook pro but not quite as bit as the one on current "" macbook pros.  i find this preferable because it is just the right size where i'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as i type.  if you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- no touchbar multiexclamation   halleluja multiexclamation - decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.there are some cons, but they are pretty minor imo:- only the left side has usb-c ports, in contrast to the pro which has them on both sides.  the right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that is useful to you.  however, i have managed fine without usb on the right side.- it would be nice if i did not have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  on pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- if you are one of the  people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (i however consider this a good thing)- although the speakers have improved in quality since previous air models, the pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  you may feel like you have gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a pro model.  personally, i have gotten used to it plus i use airpods most of the time anyway.- the air does not have an hdmi port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide hdmi.- storage capacity is workable but limited.  would be nice to get at least  tb of storage in the future.  in the meantime i just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.i'm a software engineer and the m macbook air exceeds my needs and expectations.  i think i will just be buying the air model in the future because it is terrific value for the price point.  $ might be expensive for some, but i can assure you that it is a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  i have owned many non-apple laptops in the past and i ended up hating all of them.  on the other hand, i never regret owning an apple device.  this is coming from someone who formerly used windows and linux.  i got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  apple is not perfect multistop  my last macbook pro chugged along for over  years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops i owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how i treated them.",never happier hesitant get smaller pro started suffer keyboard issue repaired keyboard twice must something wrong voltage regulation itanyhow could resist idea arm based went since think pro model silicon yet could wrong thatlong story short meet need flying color turn im perfectly comfortable screen need bigger oneeverything fast let moniker deceive unless heavy gaming arm processor future consumer computing battery life insane still comprehend many hour thing survives unplugged take flight across country never need plug get worried run power even im charging phone slim light perfect traveling completely solid state moving part fan whirring anything like extension first point run arm build window insanely well parallel even run halo ce near full speed macos stable retina screen nice despite people saying camera actually better one old pro say camera good adequate imo thing considered incredible value really deal price larger touchpad old pro quite bit one current pro find preferable right size im constantly hitting palm type type lot touchpad probably annoy le still plenty surface area touchbar multiexclamation halleluja multiexclamation decent sound speaker considering size constraintthere con pretty minor imo left side usbc port contrast pro side right side analog audio jack however useful however managed fine without usb right side would nice click fingerprint sensor button get sense finger wake system pro fingerprint sensor always active one people planet want touchbar however consider good thing although speaker improved quality since previous model pro still going better sounding speaker may feel like gotten bit downgrade regard coming pro model personally gotten used plus use airpods time anyway hdmi port buy expensive adapter provide hdmi storage capacity workable limited would nice get least tb storage future meantime back stuff external drive periodically clear downloads folderim software engineer exceeds need expectation think buying model future terrific value price point might expensive assure robust saving money long run owned many nonapple laptop past ended hating hand never regret owning device coming someone formerly used window linux got tired hardware software breaking quickly perfect multistop last pro chugged along year keyboard repeatedly failed still beat previous laptop owned numerous problem unrelated treated

positive,"a close to perfect laptop for college students (or anyone, really). (heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but i wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).the macbook air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. one caveat that has always plagued the macbook air of years past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the pro line). that was why i always got a macbook pro in years past. this time around, when apple announced the new m chip, i was curious, so i watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new air (the air has the same chipset as the macbook pro, with the same ghz at ., while saving $). i am on a budget, but i also didnt want to sacrifice performance, so i was a little nervous i was missing out by not getting the pro, but thankfully i have not had to sacrifice a thing.i am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running adobe photoshop and adobe indesign, etc. i previously purchased a  macbook pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-march when i made a grievous error and went out and purchased a lenovo yoga c with gb of ram, intel i processor at a whopping price tag of $ multistop  buyers remorse soon followed as the yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. the only thing that i liked was the speaker set-up and the k touch screen. other than that, i was beyond disappointed. i sent it back, and went back to using my  macbook pro, until i purchased this air.so the pros:fantastic battery lifei have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. it will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you arent totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like i do. its great to know you do not have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and itll still have battery to spare). a win in my book.heat management and fanless designi am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why i always love the macbooks and detest windows (hence sending the lenovo back).  the fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. i do not have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. i also like that i do not have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. i can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry im blocking a fan exhaust.  again, another win in my book.slim designat . pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like youre lugging around a brick. i also liked the tapered design as its a little more ergonomic than my macbook pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. its a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.keyboardgone are the butterfly mechanisms of macbooks past. one thing i really missed when i gave up my  macbook pro was the keyboard! thankfully with the new air and pros, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers do not feel like theyre hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.trackpadi love, love the force touch trackpad. i still believe apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. hands down. its smooth as butter.performancethis is the little machine that could. it puts my  pro to shame. it also outperforms the lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. i can have multiple tabs in safari open, photoshop, apple music, microsoft word, and this doesnt even break a sweat. i also like that i can do some light video editing on this. for most peopleespecially college studentsthis computers power should be more than sufficient. keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. again, thats if youre editing like multiple k videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average joe that may only need to do the occasional video projectno problem! this computer can handle it!screenits nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like i do.speakersi am a music junkie, and i have to constantly have music going when im working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. good stereo separation and punchy. they could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but thats to be expected for such small speaker drivers. i am more than pleased with them. they also work good for binge-watching shows on netflix.the cons (there are few):the webcamits a p webcam, and well, it looks like a p webcam. its a little grainy and washed out. it will do in a pinch, but youd think in  wed get an upgrade on the webcam.the lack of portsin true apple fashion, the i/o is somewhat lacking. you have  thunderbolt  ports, of which you cannot plug in an external gpu, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that apples m system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which i am sure will be resolved in future iterations). i would have liked to have seen at least one usb-a port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. but thats just me being nit-picky.m chip running intel appsbecause apples m chip runs on arm and most apps are coded for intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new apple chip natively (like adobe creative cloud). you might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. so far, i havent really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. i am sure here soon it will not be a problem. again, its nit-picking.--to sum up: this macbook air is a winner. i would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and i would absolutely buy it again. you get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the pro line. i am very happy with this computer and think i might just have come as close as i can to the perfect laptop for my needs.happy shopping!",close perfect college student anyone really headsup review lengthy wanted cover every

negative,"lack of ports. apple makes an incredible product. but their contempt for the customer knows no end. this is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the macbook aires and even some powerbooks. and everything is put into those two. the separate power port is gone. the separate video out port is gone. in some cases, even the audio out port is gone. all they leave you with is two usb ports which they expect you to use for everything. for a lot of people, like myself, multiple ports are needed for constant use. they are needed for external hard drives (especially for file backup where you do not want to use the apple cloud which is susceptible to nsa snooping), external dvd and cd burners, special printers that do not work with bluetooth, special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult, drawing pads, etc. etc. etc. and do not tell me to just get an external hub. i have tried them all and none of them provide proper power to external tools that need it. plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker. in summation, apple needs to start giving consideration to the customer is needs and not just to some fancy ""updated"" technology. bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools. we need physical ports. please put them back on the macbooks, especially the ""aires"". and stop taking them off of the mac cubes. the last one i bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work. please apple, bring back the ports. otherwise i may be forced, god forbid, to go back to microsoft computers.",lack port make incredible product contempt customer know end especially exemplified reduction port two aire even powerbooks everything put two separate power port gone separate video port gone case even audio port gone leave two usb port expect use everything lot people like multiple port needed constant use needed external hard drive especially file backup want use cloud susceptible nsa snooping external dvd cd burner special printer work bluetooth special mouse people like handicap make trackpads difficult drawing pad etc etc etc tell get external hub tried none provide proper power external tool need plus frequently get hotter firecracker summation need start giving consideration customer need fancy updated technology bluetooth work dependably real pain time available external tool need physical port please put back macbooks especially aire stop taking cube last one bought audio port causing extreme problem video production work please bring back port otherwise may forced god forbid go back microsoft computer

and yes, the dreaded beach ball has reared it is ugly head. well, this got me to assess what i will be using the machine for and for how long.storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. ram is another story. when you constantly use up ram, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the ssd to store temporary files. one of the youtube reviewers (created labs) explains it like this: ram memory is like writing on a white board, it is made to be temporary. writing to the ssd is like writing on paper with a pencil. it can be erased, but if it is written on and erased for too long, it is going to degrade the medium. it will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these m macbooks, none of the parts are replaceable. the ssd and the ram are soldered onto the board.***as ridiculously expensive as apple ram is, when it is not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case,  gb.i really doubt that apple will be making machines with user upgradable ram after the switch from intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end pro models.there is also the fact that if i am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a m with a fan will be helpful. upgrading to the cheaper ($+upgrades) m mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the pro apps, but i need a laptop, so multistop  so, that is why i'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the macbook pro m), with  gb ram and  tb ssd.***a note on browsers, safari is by far the best browser to run on the m, at least for now. i always had issues with saving web pages as pdf files in chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. in safari, it is worked perfectly.------i purchased the macbook air m,  core gpu, and  core cpu model, with  gb ssd and  gb ram in person at the apple store (--), with education pricing. i traded in my (mnyhll/a) -  "" macbook with the intel m processor,  gb ssd,  gb ram. i kept my charging adapter and c-cable (which are both compatible with the m late  macbook air), so ended up with a $ apple store instant credit towards the m.the m model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including final cut and logic pro. admittedly the  mb was the bottom of the line and i suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single c-port fiasco.i likely would have gone with the  core gpu model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but i wanted  gb of ssd space, so i paid more by going with eh  core. from everything that i have seen, the lack of more ram upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the intel x processors and is really only useful when you have many gpu intensive ""pro apps"" running at the same time.i would never have dreamed of running final cut or logic pro on the  macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.i would say that the bottom line is that if you are someone who only uses a laptop for office and basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-apple programs that have not been compiled for the m chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the m. if however, you really need a machine that is much more capable, faster and cooler running than the intel models, it is a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable mac.",make sure get much memory storage afford special order need update three week im still really impressed core cpu core gpu ssdgb ram updated plea make sure get much memory storage afford special order one projected future needremember mac live long time value hold depend usable someone else even year long ago gb hard drive huge multistop upgradable ram upgradable ssd ram machine upgradablethe one issue memory hog tend lot tab open caught safari open one browser chrome another running affinityfinal cut pro yes dreaded beach ball reared ugly head well got ass using machine longstorage added external drive slower let scrape ram another story constantly use ram system start using swap memory us ssd store temporary file one youtube reviewer created lab explains like ram memory like writing white board made temporary writing ssd like writing paper pencil erased written erased long going degrade medium take year cause problem keep mind macbooks none part replaceable ssd ram soldered onto boardas ridiculously expensive ram upgradable get maximum case gbi really doubt making machine user upgradable ram switch intel complete except possibly high end pro modelsthere also fact going decent amount video editing fan helpful upgrading cheaper upgrade mini would cheapest way get better performance pro apps need multistop im planning return machine get one likely pro gb ram tb ssda note browser safari far best browser run least always issue saving web page pdf file chrome save imagestext page safari worked perfectlyi purchased core gpu core cpu model gb ssd gb ram person store education pricing traded mnyhlla intel processor gb ssd gb ram kept charging adapter ccable compatible late ended store instant credit towards mthe model blown away speed smooth running large number apps open including final cut logic pro admittedly mb bottom line suffered frequent overheating issue many thing open single cport fiascoi likely would gone core gpu model one stock time purchase wanted gb ssd space paid going eh core everything seen lack ram upgrade nearly important intel x processor really useful many gpu intensive pro apps running timei would never dreamed running final cut logic pro amazing upgrade mei would say bottom line someone us office basic web surfing tab open never experience overheating dreaded beach ball responding issue nonapple program compiled chip hold upgrade apps run natively however really need machine much capable faster cooler running intel model solid buy amazing upgrade nonupgradable

positive,"great specs for an entry-level laptop. i was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i windows laptop and tablet. the  macbook air m screen is sharp, the m processor performance is similar to intel i quad core for most uses . this laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. i edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. the gb ram/ gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. the mac os memory management allows gb to be more than enough for my projects. the m cpu performance and battery life for the macbook air m easily exceed those of my dual core i windows laptop and tablet. my photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my windows devices. also, the macbook air m performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my windows devices. this laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. i purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. i would suggest most users get the gb or larger internal ssd so you will not need an external ssd for video/music storage. i currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. the only possible drawbacks for the macbook air are there are only  usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the m cpu. i run microsoft office  on my macbook air. i notice that office  takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded office  runs as fast as it does on windows.  i do not use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so i cannot comment on those uses. i was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. do not get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the macbook pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it does not have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. for most users, just use and enjoy your  macbook air m multiexclamation ",spec entrylevel looking upgrade current dual core intel window tablet screen sharp processor performance similar intel quad core us fanless get warmhot constantly exporting large gb file otherwise run cool cold edit photo editing software open much faster edits occur quickly gb ram gb ssd combo fast responsive o memory management allows gb enough project cpu performance battery life easily exceed dual core window tablet photo editing software run faster responsive window device also performance seems whether battery ac power unlike window device fantastic entrylevel device hard core gamers video creator upgrade pro model largermore vibrant screen richer audio cooling fan additional usbc port sd card slot dual monitor capability ramssd option purchased used base model used substantial saving list price made fantastic value would suggest user get gb larger internal ssd need external ssd videomusic storage currently use external ssd drive store large file small gb ssd size base model issue possible drawback usbc datacharging port may need purchase dock need multiple connection option use older usb accessory sd card slot software apps still updated cpu run microsoft office notice office take second two longer load loaded office run fast window use gaming video editing connect multiple monitor comment us expecting level performance entrylevel device get caught hype base model replace pro model heavy work load professional use heat distribution fan dissipate heat prevent thermal throttling heavy computing gaming user use enjoy multiexclamation

positive,"m macbook air review - a student is perspective introas a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. the new macbook air powered by the m chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by apple. although it looks just like the previous models, the m chip delivers insanely great performance.design and buildsince its inception, macbook airs design and build were one of its core selling points, and the macbook air m is no exception. it has that signature aluminium body that youll see with the other macbook variants. the laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your moneys worth. you can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. one of the things that the original macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a p panel. and brought is a beautiful p wide color gamut *p panel, the overall viewing experience is awesome! the bezels are the same size as last year is model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it is not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. the updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, im yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that i like better than the ones made by apple. the dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.storagestorage is also very important as a college student. as you are going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and zoom lectures. the macbook air comes with up to tb of ssd storage. this specific model i have only had gb of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you do not want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external ssd or hard drive. this will cost you way less than what apple offers.portabilityas a college student in , because of covid, it is been kinda different, (very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. so if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. the macbook air weighs in at . pounds and is .mm thick. this laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. this is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over . pounds. this laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.reliability and batterythe apple macbook air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. the macbook air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let is talk about the chip thats made all this possible.the biggest change this year is no doubt the m chip, the arm-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as k video editing, in fact, i managed to edit an entire k video on the m macbook air and the performance and exporting times were very impressive. anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of macbook air. now if you are considering this device for video editing then i would highly recommend the  gig variant.the next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, i think this is the best battery life i have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. the laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. i can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.conclusionoverall theres a quote that says, speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction. (mahatma gandhi). the macbook air m has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. its portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody whos always on the go, and im personally really excited for the direction that apple is heading towards with their new m lineup of processers.",review student perspective introas college student reliable portable workstation extremely valuable new powered chip one exciting device recently released although look like previous model chip delivers insanely performancedesign buildsince inception air design build one core selling point exception signature aluminium body youll see variant look premium definitely feel like money worth easily open one finger possible incredibly engineered hinge design done one thing original lacked decent display gone day p panel brought beautiful p wide color gamut p panel overall viewing experience awesome bezel size last year model kinda disappointing compared laptop recently released something ruin overall viewing experience updated magic keyboard better travel also gigantic mouse pad always blessing im yet find trackpad like better one made dual speaker grill produce pretty decent sound however slight distortion high volumesstoragestorage also important college student going need space store document file zoom lecture come tb ssd storage specific model gb storage honestly fine student want spend lot money always buy external ssd hard drive cost way le offersportabilityas college student covid kinda different small pauseall class nowadays held zoom online platform wan na use outside typical campus setting portability start matter weighs pound mm thick easily fit backup without feeling noticeable weight difference important lot student especially backtoback class keeping mind average textbook weighs pound also easily fit handbag woman wonderingreliability batterythe proven one reliable laptop student past decade going compelling student insanely reliable performance price let talk chip thats made possiblethe biggest change year doubt chip armbased chip fast like stupid fast application open real quick performance consistently reliable easily fly daytoday task like browsing internet typing research paper also handle intensive task k video editing fact managed edit entire k video performance exporting time impressive anyway sometimes impossible previousgens considering device video editing would highly recommend gig variantthe next best thing aside insane performance incredible battery life think best battery life ever seen form factor lasted multiple day light usage usual workload typing browsing streaming content pull full day heavy usage task like editing photo videosconclusionoverall there quote say speed irrelevant going wrong direction mahatma gandhi set new benchmark consistent performance delivers insanely awesome battery life make overall experience pretty fire portability reliability speed make investment student also anybody who always go im personally really excited direction heading towards new lineup processers

positive,"great laptop for a solid price i was able to get this mac for around $ in nov. . it arrived quickly and very well packed for shipping. i'm really enjoying it overall up to this point. it is definitely not a super powerful machine but for just normal everyday use it seems to be a very solid choice. coming from a mid  macbook air its quite literally a night and day difference. snappy response, amazing display in a very sleek form factor. if i had to complain about something, i would note that the keyboard has an extremely small travel making it a bit odd using experience at first but it is something you quickly overcome with just a couple hours of usage. then, what i would consider the biggest downside is the lack of ports. a total of  usb-c ports and a headphone jack is all you get. luckily there are countless usb-c hubs available for a decent price. i spent around $ and got one that not only has all ports i could possibly need but also allows for a -monitor output. i would say for the price it is really hard to find much i do not like about it. when looking into a new mac i was originally looking into the m air but after reading up on them i heard a lot of complaints regarding overheating as well as slower overall peak speeds due to it using  single gb ram stick opposed to the m using  gb sticks allowing for the system to run more smoothly. when buying a base model, you are already going into it with a relatively small hard drive and low total ram so when given the option i found it just made more sense to go with the m at the time of purchase. that decision was solidified when the m went on sale making it a nearly $ price difference between the two models. to summarize, if you are looking for a reliable macbook at a ""cheap"" price to have as an everyday mess around machine i % would say this is the one. it is nothing super powerful but it is far from sluggish. great for normal use, streaming, browsing and minor editing etc. i have yet to find a situation in my regular use it could not handle, so for me it is exactly what i needed.",solid price able get around nov arrived quickly well packed shipping im really enjoying overall point definitely super powerful machine normal everyday use seems solid choice coming mid quite literally night day difference snappy response amazing display sleek form factor complain something would note keyboard extremely small travel making bit odd using experience first something quickly overcome couple hour usage would consider biggest downside lack port total usbc port headphone jack get luckily countless usbc hub available decent price spent around got one port could possibly need also allows monitor output would say price really hard find much like looking new originally looking reading heard lot complaint regarding overheating well slower overall peak speed due using single gb ram stick opposed using gb stick allowing system run smoothly buying base model already going relatively small hard drive low total ram given option found made sense go time purchase decision solidified went sale making nearly price difference two model summarize looking reliable cheap price everyday mess around machine would say one nothing super powerful far sluggish normal use streaming browsing minor editing etc yet find situation regular use could handle exactly needed

positive,"still competes with the new m model. picked up this model on sale for $. if you can get it on sale, i would recommend it even over the new m macbook air (if you are getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and do not need all the bells and whistles of a pro model.this has actually replaced a windows machine that i was using for a long time for my daily workflow, and even with only  gb of memory compared to  on the windows one, i find that this machine runs much better. it runs right out of the box without needing to spend a couple hours uninstalling bloat that comes standard with almost every windows laptop that sucks up my ram and cpu if i do not remove it. the only downside is that the  gb of ssd is a bit light, but since i mostly work off the cloud anyway, it is not a deal breaker. if you do need more, i would recommend buying a model with that space built in as you would need to get an external drive otherwise.pros vs. m air:- ssd is a bit faster (as it is two  gb modules running in parallel, while the new one is a single module) which also is a slight boost to longevity.- there is no notch on the display (i personally do not mind it, but if that is a sticking point for you this or the "" m pro model would probably serve you better).- slightly improved cooling system (neither air model has an active cooling setup, but the integrated heat spreader on the m model is a fair bit smaller so it throttles itself a bit sooner), but not major if you do not plan on pushing too hard (and if you are, the m/mpro/mmax mbp is probably better suited for you anyway).- i find that i like the way the keyboard types a little more on the m model over the m. it is definitely a matter of personal preference, but it feels a bit nicer to type on for me. might be down to the fact that it uses the traditional wedge shape which gives a little bit of an angle to the keyboard, where the m mba is more like the  mbp shape.cons vs. m air:- no dedicated magsafe charging port, meaning that you only get one available usb-c port to use when charging.- overall system performance is a bit lower than the m, but not really by a whole lot. if you are not planning on really stressing the system you will not notice.- function keys are only half height, while the m has full height keys. again, personal preference, but as someone with slightly larger hands who normally uses larger keyboards i prefer the full size keys.- webcam is only p instead of p on the m. i do not use it that much, but if you do plan to be doing a lot of zoom, facetime, etc. you may want to keep that in mind. it is still not bad, but the quality difference is something that you will notice.- sound quality is a tad weaker in my opinion, but nothing major, and i usually use my airpods or some other external speakers/headphones anyway.on the whole, it is still a great macbook. sure it is more expensive than plenty of windows laptops, but the battery performance is solid, and even with only  gb of ram (if you want more, go for a macbook pro instead), it is still overall a solid option for light to medium duty workloads due to how optimized the new apple silicon is. on programs that take full advantage of it, the boost in performance is massive. even with using rosetta for older intel-based programs, it is still quite fast. compared to any intel machine that came before it, it blows them out of the park with superior performance and battery life.if you can get it on sale, or a good refurbished one (in that case i recommend going directly to apple), it is probably one of the best laptops on the market right now. for students and anyone looking for a mac that is lightweight but capable, this is a solid choice.",still competes new model picked model sale get sale would recommend even new getting base model want capable machine handle day day task need bell whistle pro modelthis actually replaced
