sounds great i can get so much work done when i don’t hear anybody,53,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i got mine a couple of days ago and the only downside is that it only works in the right airpod. it has been like that ever since i got it and i have not been able to fix that issue since. does anyone know what i can do to potentially fix it? i spent over $90.00 for only one airpod to work when i first got it.,54,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
great battery lifd,55,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"these work great even though i do not have an iphone, i use them with my android phone and i was worried about compatibility issues but gratefully i did not come across any. i got them over the other in-ear headphones because my ear starts to ache if something is inside it too long. these are perfect as they stay just near the outer part allowing my inner ear to get some breathing space. sound quality is great as expected from the brand however the noise cancelling could be better. but that's a price to pay for my ear to not be fully closed off. a lot of the advertised features don't work because i'm not using an iphone (such as siri, ear detection or even battery detection - which can be frustrating). but here are some features that did work:- you cannot double tap to get to siri (or google) but the double tap instead works to pause or play the media!- you can still use just one earphone since they both connect differently. (will need to change settings to allow for mono audio, this can be found in accessibility).",56,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
brought for god daughter she loves them. noise cancellation & good battery life.!,57,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i love how long i can listen to music with these,58,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i've tried a lot of pod and over the head gear for longs hours of work. for whatever reason, these sit in my ear most comfortably. i actually hate noise cancelling features because i like hearing what's going on around me. much better than holding a handheld to my ear like the ""old"" days!",59,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i have never owned a apple earphone before, however i have purchased many expensive and cheap earphones in the past. for near 90 dollars these are perfect. i doubt the 250 dollar newest versions are necessary. best not to find out!of course not losing these are the true challenge.it's super, super small.",63,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
got for my son on prime day. he loves them!,64,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i liked using product the size was pretty good, the lasted for about 3 hours before needing to be charged. if i were to buy airpods again would by this model it's easily one the best airpods the audio is good but when on a phone call could be better. though compared to others it's audio when talking on the phone is better.",65,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
u hear very very good with the buds. would buy again very happy with them just love them u would enjoy them if u have and iphone. buy them u be happy,66,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i so regret buying these.  they sound great.  but they are no comfortable and they fall out of the ears easily.  once one fell out and almost landed in the toilet.  i bought some sheath to put on them which keeps them in my ears better but still not comfortable and they do still come out slowly.  i will buy bose beats next.  these suck.  i’m an apple girl but i cannot recommend these.,67,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
came same day and just as described....,68,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
love these but noticed that one pod charged and other didn’t. used a q-tip to wipe each end and inside the charge case. then made sure that the pods both showed a ⚡️ on iphone to be sure both were charging. it’s the only way to make sure!,69,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i'm so cheap that i decided i would buy the knockoff versions of these first. bad idea. just get the real thing first time around. these fit well so i don't have to keep adjusting them, they pair easily (to my phone and my computer), the sound quality is good, and when i'm on a call or a meeting, i can be easily heard by whoever i'm talking to. they are not 100% noise canceling, but it's good enough. worth the money for the aulity!",82,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"use them every day to listen to pod casts, music and e books. they are very comfortable.",83,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i have never purchased anything from apple.  being on the phone for hours each day having a nice pair of earphone is very important to me.  friends recommended me getting airpods and i think it is  probably the best on the market when it comes to comfort level, noise reduction and battery power.  i wouldn't use it to for music listening since the sound quality can't compare with bose.  it's a must have device if you're on the phone for hours each day.",84,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

overall it’s a good product but i constantly have issues connecting it to my phone. when i take one of the pods out of the case and put it in my ear it never connects to the phone i typically have to end the call and connect the pods then call the person back for it to function properly,98,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
legit these dont have noise cancelation though they are still very good loud and sounds great,99,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i give these airpods a 5/5 stars because they are excellent :) they have a very long battery life and they are actually noise canceling, even with one airpod in your ear. i had airpod pros before i brought these but lost them back in february, and i actually like these better than the pros because they don’t feel heavy in your ear. airpod pros are smaller than these, so they’re more likely to fall out your ear. with these, they stay in your ear without feeling so heavy, and won’t have to worry about them falling out! only downside i have about these airpods are that after about 2 months, my left airpod sounded a little low. but that’s nothing a little setting adjusting won’t fix :) overall these are excellent headphones!",100,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

these are great headphones. they are good quality but not a great fit for my ears. they always feel like they're about to fall out. i also have to turn the volume all the way up in order to hear while i'm on the treadmill. i'm guessing if they fit in my ears better i wouldn't have to do that. other than that i love them. i love the charging case too.,156,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"in the 80's i thought apple's computers were novel. since then i avoid apple products for the most part (long story). i recognize their innovation. i purchased a pair of apple's $15 wired pods for the gym, primarily because they were inexpensive. i was impressed with the sound for such an inexpensive price, but the wire from the pods just got in the way at the gym. prior to this purchase i bought another pair of buds, i was sadly disappointed. i figured i'd give the apple pods a try kind of expecting the same sound quality as the wired pods, but wireless. wow, these are so much better, the bass is warm, the mid and highs are crisp but not harsh or fatiguing, these are amazingly good. still not an apple fan, but i do give credit where credit is due. i'd buy these again.",243,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i brought these on a whim after deciding not jump on the wagon. i was surprised to find that i like them but i mostly use them at night to listen to content on the way to sleep. i have found they don't maintain a charge for longer than 6-7 hours. other than that- no complaints. decent enough but i've had others that held a charge for at least 24 hours.,251,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"they sound great, are easy to charge and store, the batteries last a very long time, and the noise canceling feature works very well. they are really easy to connect to any device too. but they have a tendency to fall out of my ear, and that costs them a star. maybe it is just my particular ears, but almost every time i use them, one manages to fall out and hit the ground at some point. because of that, i have to be careful where i use them. motorcycle rides and river activities are out of the question. once one fell out while i was on the riding mower, and it took me about ten very stressful minutes to find it. i have since learned that it helps to wrap a bandanna around my head and ears when mowing. unfortunately this isn't a perfect solution either, as the other day one still managed to fall out and hit the ground when mowing. fortunately i found it right away that time.thank goodness they certainly do seem to be very durable. my kid's airpod pros got washed and dried, and they still worked! i heard them clanking around in the drier for 30 minutes, but thought it was just a nickel or something.anyway, for around the house or office they are great. but don't think you can trust them to go anywhere.",252,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

unless you turn them up full blast they are not noise canceling. i can hear a lot of what’s going on around me when i have these in which kinda sucks but oh well. sound quality get worse and worse over time and eventually they will sound so low you need to get another pair of earphones! happened to me and within months of getting my new pair they would sound bad already.,318,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i had recently purchased the apple airpods 2nd generation, and while i am happy with my purchase, there are some elements of the design, function and use that bother me, needless to say i feel happy with my purchase. as this generation is not the newest, some of my complaints have been addressed through the new release of the next generation of apple airpods, however, that brings me to my first issue, cost. the price of these earphones, even being “out of date” is still significantly higher than competitors with a range of 80 - 130 usd.  furthermore, with the design of the airpods, and the hard shell they come in, after using the product for a significant amount of time, they start to hurt your ears and make them sore. this is counterproductive from their main function and design, with their wireless capabilities and small design meant to not only fit snugly, but be able to be forgotten about. with the amount of substitute goods on the market, there are clearly a wide range of options to choose from. so why did i choose to buy the apple airpods?when this product first came out, the high price and novelty was somewhat justified, as this was a big step in change for apple, as well, they had just gotten rid of their headphone jack in their phones, almost forcing people to switch over to different headphones. as well the sound quality was incredibly clear and the airpods allowed you to wear them for hours on end with just one charge. one of the biggest things i love about the airpods is how easy it is to transfer them, there are no cords to get tangled and they come in a small case. what really convinced me to invest in these earphones though was a friend of mine, sarah, when she explained how she loved to go on walks and runs with them, and they don’t fall out and make for a very fun experience. she encouraged me to get the airpods because they are a great benefit “not only for your class, but also just for your every day life”. i am not the biggest runner but i do love to go on outdoor hikes with my dog, and so after hearing her review i went out to go purchase a pair.",379,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
easy to use,380,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i recently bought these last month and after a month of usage i find this product to be very well designed. but i think personally there are still some design flaws.1. you can't wear it very long- after a certain point maybe after 2 hours, you ears start to hurt especially if your playing loud music or something.-the battery on these earphones aren't the best either 4 hours are the longest they've ever lasted after a full night's charge too 100%2. this is not an honest product- i live in new york city, a very loud place, so when i see noise canceling, i want to be able to not hear the noises on the train on my commutes to work, school and home. so in terms of noise canceling, i don't think this product is very honest.but otherwise the product is great, the sound quality is great (unless your on a call at the same time), the case doesn't need to be charged to often, it's very good if you need a quality wireless earphone.",381,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i use these with my new ipad, my dell inspiron 13 laptop, and my samsung galaxy s8 phone. they pretty much always stay in my ears unless i really shake them out. they have pretty good sound quality, though i'm not much of a sound buff. sometimes though when i'm using my phone the airpods disconnect from each other creating a double echo sound, which is really uncomfortable for me - i have to disconnect the airpods and reconnect them to fix it. i'm someone who needs to have a constant stream of music in my ears, so this has been a godsend because it's so easy to do chores while having them in. i've never been able to mess with volume with just the airpods, and i can't pause/unpause with just the airpods on non-apple devices. but i can skip to the next song on my phone by tapping the right airpod twice. i've dropped them and had them go flying out of the case at least ten times but they're still fine.",433,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

apple airpods….. what more needs to be said?!?!? reasonably priced and fast delivery! work great! i highly suggest investing in a case or 3 for them to help protect them from breaking. they are not very well protected without a case and can be broken quite easily if dropped (well the outter holding case is quite easy to break or crack if dropped) just makes sense to invest $20 or less to help protect them,452,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i wanted to try some of these and when they had a good price here on amazon i went ahead and purchased a pair  i wasn't prepared to pay the price for the newest version. i also have a set of beats earbuds which are very nice and probably fit my ear a bit better but that's mainly because they sort of twist into your ear. these being a different thing altogether, where they slide into your ear and hang there is nice because they don't pop out, on the other hand the sound quality is going to work better if they fit tightly in your ear versus loosely so a lot of that's is going to depend on the individual. they have fine audio reproduction but as you might expect with such small speakers the base is a bit light and the noise cancellation seems to work but it's only going to work if there's a good seal around the earbud and the ear itself so once again that's going to depend on your ear. they are slightly larger than some but i didn't find that to be a problem. they  work well in a work out, mainly because if you're going to use earbuds and are using ones that fit tightly into your ear, like beats, they're more likely to work their way out during your exercise program as you move your head and so forth. if they seem a good price you can't go wrong",745,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i ordered these and i was skeptical but they say they are apple and i checked the airpods and they seem legit the only problem is they feel cheap maybe because that just how they feel but the hinge is weird i’m not sure if i messed them up but they also came in it’s film still it wasn’t opened and it just seemed like a brand new pack of airpods,748,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i have been looking for a good quality and easy functioning set of wireless headphones. most of them don't fit my tiny ears especially the ones that go into the ear canal (rubber ones)..ugh. i did not want to invest the money into the apple brand but after going through about 6 different brands of headphones under $80 i finally gave up and got these. they pair very easily- responsive to touch, battery in case lasts about 4-5 charges for me. only downsides are-the total battery usage time- i am lucky to get 5 hours out of them before charging. if it was at least 8 so people can make it through their work shift that would be a plus. also, if there was a volume touch command it would be great but instead tells you to ask siri. taptap to skip forward but a swipe up/down would be nice for volume control.overall they are worth it.",888,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

wireless airpods are the best and i feel more confident these will remain in my ear.  i compared them to the newer version short stick and i like these better.  great therapy at the dentist to cancel out drill noise.  i have regular bluetooth wire earpods i’ll continue to use as a backup for exercise. i feel these will stay in place for walking.  it is a little difficult to advance songs by tapping but with practice i hope i’ll adjust to them,936,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i bought these for multiple uses: music, podcasts, conference calls and watching training and youtube videos.  i’m sure someone who is knowledgeable in audio products could better vouch for the sound quality of these versus the newer versions, i’m just an everyday guy and these work perfectly for all the uses i’ve mentioned.i’m an apple ecosystem guy, and the seamless and instant pairing and compatibility were the main reason i got these instead of knock offs.  i’ve tried the cheap route before and from intermittent pairing/dropping, to being completely unable to use with multiple devices, and these were worth the extra money to avoid that.they average about 2-4 hours of use per charge, and with the quick recharge of the case i’ve never had to worry about dead earphones.  i love these, the newer versions might be technically better, but for the value i don’t think you can beat these.",1081,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"these work well after a learning curve. took a while to find out how to ""double tap"" to answer calls, pause podcasts, etc..  didn't realize at first that i had to tap over the very small hole in the devices. don't think that all the features that work with an iphone will work with my android phone. but so far they work great or what i use them for. frees me up so i don't have to carry my phone around the house when listening to a podcast or audiobook. love the small holder and recharging device. that works really well. don't like that i need to have another charging cable with the apple end on it. but the cord comes with so not a big deal.",1082,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"honestly i thought these airpods were just all hype, another thing apple put out for you to buy and blah, blah, blah. but man i cannot say how wrong i was. these things are so freakin convenient! you can wear one ear and still get awesome benefits with or wear both if your in a situation where you don't need to hear your surroundings. when my phone mic on my phone is acting stupid and people cant hear me on calls, this eliminates the problem completely,  plus i can get stuff done not having to hold the phone.i should address my subject about the ears. i have tiny ears and these fit great!  i had read reviews about the pro and other versions just were too big so i am really happy i got these. they dont hurt like some oflther buds if u have small ears and they dont fall out. i havent jogged with them yet so will have to see how that goes.they connect so easily to your phone and if you have the watch as well, it automatically syncs as your phone does. wish i had gotten these a long time ago because they are really more than i coulda imagined.",1119,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

this is my 3rd pair. usually last 2 years and then battery doesn’t hold a charge too long anymore. there are options out there for apple airpod swaps for about $50 depending on condition of your replacement and you get a used replacement with a brand new battery. how long those batteries last is yet to be determined. did that for my daughter using my old apple airpod and she has been using it without issues for about 3 months now. search for airpod swap on google if you want this.,1125,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"airpods second generation is wireless bluetooth earbuds designed by apple inc. they are white wireless earbuds that come inside a case that uses bluetooth from your phone. you can watch videos, listen to music, or even hear anything that comes from your phone. they know when they're inserted in your ear and are ready to work as soon as you put them in, and additionally, they'll pause audio automatically when you remove them. the product is really easy to use. all you have to do is put them in your ear, go to your setting and connect them to your phone, and play whatever you like from your phone.  i have had this product for 2 years now and i still love them even though they come out with new ones almost every year or 2. my experience with airpods has been great. i haven't ever had a problem with my airpods. i feel like the second generation is enough for me because all the generations work the same, they just get better and louder, and since i have had them for so long i think it's time for me to upgrade and get new ones. everybody i know uses this product, and they love them. airpods are really popular in the teenage world, almost every teenager has a pair of airpods, and loves them.  air pods sound fantastic for their size, and the battery life for the airpods alone are great for their size, the charging case battery life is actually 10 times better than the airpods battery life to me the charging case stays charged longer than the actual airpods. airpods have an amazing microphone, you can talk to siri through airpods, and make phone calls, and have amazing sound. they don't only connect from your iphone but they can connect from your ipad, or apple watch as well, which is great for when you don't have your phone but still want to listen to music.  there are not many cons with airpods, but there are a few. air pods are really tiny, but that doesn't affect the sound in any way, it only affects if it will stay in your ear for so long, or if they don't fit your ears at all, because a lot of people tend to have a problem with them not fitting in everyone's ears, and since they are so tiny, it is really easy for them to get lost or misplaced definitely if they fall out of your ear and you don't even notice that they have fallen out. they are also easy to get misplaced if you don't put them back into the case right away after using them. all apple products are pretty much waterproof, but i feel like this is the only product that is not waterproof, and if they keep improving and making better ones they should all be waterproof. airpods are not good for athletes, or for people who just like to work out because if you are doing a lot of moving with these airpods in your ear 9 times out of 10 they will fall out.  i highly recommend someone to buy airpods. they are good for everyone. if you are just chilling, or just love music, or want to talk on the phone they are really convenient to people who don't like holding their phones up to their ear when they talk. as i said before, everyone i know around me has airpods and they are definitely great for teenagers. they will be a wonderful gift for someone, they are worth the price because the sound is amazing and they close out everything else around you.",1192,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i was reluctant to spend this much on a non-necessity for myself but i am so glad that i did. i listen to podcasts all day at work and only wear one headphone so i am still able to communicate. i am on my feet all day running around. i used to wear corded headphones and would snag the cord if it was popping out of my shirt and it would rip the bud out of my ear and i would go through sets quickly.now that i have these i am able to leave one in the case and switch them out as one dies so there is always one charged. the charge lasts about 6 hours  per bud and between the buds and the case, i am only plugging them in to charge about every 4 days. with these i am able to set up a queue of my podcasts and keep my phone in my desk all day. i have the double tap feature set up to pause on both so i can easily stop my podcasts to have a conversation. i love not having my phone on me or cords hanging from me. they sound great and i can’t think of a single issue i’ve had with them over the past 6 or so months. maybe there are more affordable versions but so far i am loving these. i would highly recommend them and can’t imagine how the newer/more expensive versions could be any better :)",1223,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"fits is like the 1st edition, so i love that they stay in my ears. the 3rd didn't work for me. this 2nd edition has problems, so apple replaced one of them. while at the apple store, other people were there doing the same thing. sometimes, they cut out and i haven't figured out why yet. i wish the 1st generation were still available as new. alas, it's apple. i love airpods, anyway.",1231,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

arrived quick and overall worth the money,1251,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"easy to setup and easy to use, although i have to warn anyone buying this without owning an iphone should look elsewhere, it works as regular bluetooth earbuds but you’re missing on basically every feature if you use them like that, and yes it sucks on windows. sounds good for most people, although it sounds better when you use headphone accommodations by going into settings>accessibility>audio/visual>headphone accommodations and then choose which one you prefer. it lasts about 4 hours on one charge, shorter if you’re on a call.speaking of calls, you can talk on the phone with these in your ears, works great but be mindful that these are bluetooth earbuds at the end of the day, mic quality will never be as good as something wired such as the lightning headphones you can use instead.",1252,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i waited a long, long time before buying “apple” ear pods. i have used skull candy, soundpeats, and a host of others. they all have their little quirks and variations. the apple ones do as well, but not nearly as many. overall, the quality of these is awesome. the sound is great, it allows for pass through sound so i can listen to music and still hear what’s going on around me, and the charge lasts for several hours.the downside(s). first, my ears don’t necessarily fit these (or the wired ones that always came with the iphones), so i have to adjust and push these in every once in a while. i know that’s why they came out with the pro ones with the plastic ear bud. those will be the next pair i get. secondly, live listen works great, with one caveat. i would have imagined that the mic used would have been the mics on the ear buds themselves. nope. it uses your phone mic. so, if you put your phone in your pocket and have live listen on, you hear the phone shuffling around in your pocket. in other words, you have to leave your phone out (laying on your desk, holding it in your hand, etc.) in order to use it with any success. maybe that changes on other models, but for these, it makes the live listen almost pointless. i want to be hands free, with my phone in my pocket, but be able to hear someone if they talk to me. not sure what else the concept would have been used for in using the phone mic.other than those issues, i really have no complaints. the case charges the pods quickly and multiple times, so you can continue to use them for a long time. again, sound quality is as good, if not better, than any other ear buds i’ve used. you can set what the functions are, so tapping the right ear twice can mean whatever you want versus tapping the left ear twice.i am really pleased with these and would recommend them.",1358,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

very good  but they can't adjust to fit my ears. they fall out  easily. the best advice i have found is to use a sweat band.  also the case has rounded edges and can not stand up.,1428,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i'd been on the fence about airpods for so long. how could they possibly be worth it, right? they are. earbuds with the little rubber attachments really hurt my ears after longer than a few minutes, and tend to make my ears itch. these are much more comfortable, and the best part is they stay put. i tend to fall asleep listening to audiobooks and have never once had to go searching for an earbud when i wake up. not only do they stay in my ear, but i'm in no discomfort for having slept on one for several hours. love them!",1442,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i like these a lot. i tried to go the cheap route and get knock offs to save money but they ended up breaking within 3 weeks both times. in this case, get the real ones. these are great! i was worried they would fall out of my ear and i would lose them but they stay in my ears nicely and i haven’t lost them yet. although the case is smooth and slippery and i keep dropping it. inside the case where the magnets are, it attracts dirt that i can’t seem to get off. battery life is pretty good. lasted about 6hrs with loud music playing the whole time. charged enough in about 30 minutes. they are not noise canceling. i can have the music up pretty loud and still hear a power washer running. but it does make it easier for people to sneak up on you.",1445,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i was a bit hesitant to buy these due to not being familiar with them and being used to the ear buds that are more like the pro version. that being said, i am very pleased with these! the sound quality is amazing, they fit in my ears well too! they do fall out once in a while, but not as much as my current skull candy indy ones. my only complaint would be that they don't block out as much as the pro style. i can hear myself typing when wearing these and can hear what's going on around me, which is good to a point.overall i do recommend these!!!!!",1446,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i am pleased with just about everything except for the fit. they seem too big to stay in my ears. i bought the ear clip things and it helps keep them secure.i bought the same ones for my sons and they have no problem.,1447,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"they last forever and they sound pretty good, the only thing i dislike is how they feel after a while. i’m 8 hours into a 10 hour shift right now and my ears are killing me…i’m sure the pros feel better, just saying if you’re gonna need to wear earbuds of any kind for longer than a couple hours get the pros or something. that is all. back to work!",1448,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i'm furious. i don't buy apple products. the last one i bought was a 2nd gen ipod. i gave in and bought these after trying many many many earbuds, from all across the price spectrum, and none of them worked for me. which is why i'm furious to know that these were out there the whole time, and only my hatred of apple products kept me from enjoying them.obviously there's no noise cancelation, but the fact that i can wear them for hours comfortably is fricking amazing. i'm a side sleeper and fell asleep with them in!i had recently tried the samsung live buds and the sony link buds, both hurt my ears so badly i had to return them. went with the 2nd gen over 3rd or pro because it seemed others with small ears like mine agreed this was the best fit, and i couldn't agree more.only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is apple's obnoxious desire to make you buy into their proprietary system. i have an android and a pc and neither are changing anytime soon, which means a lot of the features that would make them a 5 star buy are not available to me.",1533,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i bought a pair of these for myself and loved them so much i immediately bought my husband a pair.  they instantly paired with my phone and were a breeze to use.  the sound quality is great.  if you want to really test the sound quality listen to iron butterfly’s 2006 remastered long version (12 plus minutes) of in-a-gadda-da-vida.  the drum solo about halfway through is an absolute trip as you follow the sound around your head from ear to ear.  it’s literally like having the musicians circle you as they play.the only downside i can think of is for my neighbors who have to listen to me sing solo when i’m wearing them while working in the yard.,1691,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

my airpods had stopped working after a couple months which was very disappointing but i loved them so much while they worked that i ordered a second pair. i believe mines stopped working due to the amount of times i dropped it so i invested in a case this time around. it lasts the whole day with one charge and i can easily switch between my devices. the sound quality is great! airpods are a must have! 9/10,1886,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"ah yes, the 2nd generation airpods from apple that we've all been eyeing now. i'll keep it short - it plays sound quite nicely, with sufficient bass and crystal clear sound from all octaves and ranges. the sound quality and everything is practically perfect. it pairs effortlessly with any compatible apple device (i have an iphone) and it pairs almost before i put it in my ears. never knew not going to the bluetooth settings would be such a much-needed life-changing convenience.the only complaint is the noise cancellation. it does not have any whatsoever. do not even think there will be 'a little', because there is absolutely none. if you're in a loud environment and you're struggling to hear your music, your only real solution is to either find a quieter place or turn up the volume and hope you don't go deaf. if there was noise cancellation (airpods pro has them now), then it would be a perfect product. it is a minor inconvenience that makes it feel not worth the price. to people who think it may not be a problem, then this is the product for you. otherwise, go bump your purchase to the pros.",1894,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i purchased the apple earpods to replace another set of earbuds that kept falling out of my ears.  i have narrow ear canals and it was such a hassle to deal with, even tho' i spent $100+ for them.these earpods are fantastic!  not only do they stay in my ears, but the resonance and sound are off the charts!  i highly recommend them!!!even better was the fact they were on sale and, using my amazon points, i was able to save a bunch more, bringing the cost down to a comfortable level for me.",1957,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i have tried (and still use) the entire family of airpods.  they all have their perks.  these airpods (g2) are compact, and reasonable with decent sound quality.  the g3's are a just bit better, in my opinion, but i found out the hard way that long listening sessions (like all day, in a zoom meeting) left my ears feeling a bit sore due to the new shape, whereas the g2 don't do that, at all.the ap pros have the best sound, hands down. however, after awhile, i can't tolerate the feeling of the insert in my ear, so i can only listen for an hour or so, then i need to rest my ears.so, when you break it down, there is simply a compromise of sound quality vs. ear comfort.  so, for me, for long listening sessions, phone calls, audio books, virtual meetings, audio privacy whilst you listen to videos and whatnot, etc. the gen2 are my favorite. they are also the most pocketable, and for the current price, the g2 are tough to say no to.",1958,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"we tried at least 4-5 different “knock-off” versions of the real deal air pods. they all had some of the features and functions but nothing beat the real deal. should have saved the money and just gone with these in the first place. they are super easy to pair, to use and not fussy at all. we use them for working out, running, talking on the phone and just always have them. the battery life is excellent and overall, i wish i would have just spent the money on the real ones from the beginning — would have saved me a lot in the long run.",2047,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i’ve had several pairs of airpods. these are my favorite. i’m comparing them to the first gen, obvious these are an upgrade. also, i’ve had the pros, did not like them as they fell out of my ear all the time, even with differing sized ear inserts. i own the airpod 3 too- same problem of them falling out.the 2’s are a perfect fit for my ear as well and the pro and 3’s are painful after about 45 minutes. the controls are superior in my opinion. tap, double tap- excellent idea and works great. the squeeze on the pro and 3, odd decision practicality-wise as you have to squeeze a specific part of the airpods which can and does cause it to loosen in your ear and more easily fall out. not sure why apple did that or continues to.only thing these don’t have is noise canceling. doesn’t bother me though, i don’t like/need that feature. i hope they keep making the 2nd gen, i’ll keep buying them. best on the market at the moment.",2076,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

they are easier to use and stay in ear better than the airpods pro and 3rs gen.  sound is just as good.  only thing i miss is noise cancellation and the ability to click on airpods to start and stop the song.  full disclosure i own airpods pro as well and used to have 3rd gen that i tried and returned.  true you can double tap the 2nd gen to stop start sound but the click on newer are better. other than that i prefer these.,2083,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"these headphones are perfect for daily use. the charge time is fantastic as well as the over all life of the headsets. the sound quality is as expected, they have good low end for that they are, the mid’s are clear and high end is bright. as these are not a completely enclosed ear bud they do have a little ambient back ground bleeding. this small amount of extra noise isn’t a problem. i use these ear buds when i ride my motorcycle under my helmet. i have no problems with to much wind noice or other sounds blocking out what i’m trying to listen to. i find it’s nice to have some noice reduction with out being completely blocked off from my surroundings. i’ve had no issues with them falling out of my ears or being bumped out of place.",2290,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

babies are really really boring. if you find yourself in a situation where you have to be around one for long periods of time you need these. i was wearing the wired ones and the baby would just pull them out of my ears and suck on them. now he has no idea i'm even wearing them. i can listen to full podcasts and sing the wheels on the bus go round and round hundreds of times. the key is to cover them with your hair and only wear one at a time. i also love these for listening to sleep stories when you can't sleep at night. i used to wake up tangled in the wires.,2356,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i would like a new pair.  i think the ones i got have problems.  they only hold a charge for about an hour,2839,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"update: i exchanged the defective first pair for a new pair. the new pair paired with my phone quickly, and actually they have really good sound. they work well with my iphone and if i have my ipad nearby they will pair to that easily.they seem to stay in my ear well, the sound is crisp and clear and the bass is even decent. i wanted an option to have earbuds that didn’t totally block out the outside world that way people won’t yell at me at home and i won’t hear them.this type of earbud that is ‘not isolating’ actually is easier to use for dictation and phone calls. the ones that seal tight in your ears are muddy and have skull resonance that makes it hard to make phone calls.i am not sure of the long-term durability yet, and i am really considering buying the applecare protection just in case this new pair has problems. i am upping the review to five stars.original review: only two stars.now that the price has come down, i decided to try a set of these 2nd gen. airpods. i got an authentic, new pair, they have nice finish and feel, and the pairing details shows i can buy the applecare extended warranty, so i don't believe they are fake.i followed the setup instructions, but it only paired one earbud. the other was staticky and then had no audio. when i took out one earpod and put the other in, waited couple seconds, that one has audio. then when put the second one in, there is only stereo audio for perhaps 5-8 seconds, then one ear gets staticky or drops signal, then just one earpod.i spent the next 30 or 45 minutes (or maybe an hour) 'forgetting' the earpods, resetting the case, re-pairing them, it has the same problems. i have multiple other bluetooth earbuds, headphones, etc., and have not had problems like this. i followed the instructions from apple to the letter, and searched other websites for ideas.they just will not play both earbuds at the same time. the signal also loses connection and has signal interruptions, static, loss.when they do play together, the sound is very good to me, clear, with some bass, and they fit in my ears well. i wanted to try a pair of these so that i can hear ambient noise around me and people, other kinds i have seal tight and you can't hear anything around you (and also phone calls are harder to make since you can't hear your own voice as well.)i am going to order another set and see if that one will work properly. for $110, and the $30 extra, these airpods should work perfectly and without all these issues.i have, for instance, 4 other sets of taotronics earbuds and they work flawlessly and easily, and they were only $40 each. the apple earbuds are triple that cost and can't do a basic pairing to my iphone 13.if the second set doesn't work correctly, i'll just pass and go with a different company.",2840,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i wear them to work everyday, i have smaller ears and these (the second gen) are more comfortable than the airpod 3rd generation, because apple redesigned the shape. so these fit great. i like these more than the 3rd also because you get more flexibility with the stem whether you want to program siri or skip to next track/pause/play. with the 3rd apple has it preset and can’t be change. plus the second generation version is cheaper. highly recommended !!!",2841,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"these (2nd generation) airpods are amazing! they offer hours of fantastic sound and are a great way to listen to music and jump on a call anytime. the battery life is pretty solid, giving five hours of listen and talk time. when you place them into the case, they will automatically charge very fast allowing up to 24 hours of listening time without having to plug them in. the only downside is the terrible noise cancellation. it does not offer it as a feature in the product however the lack of noise cancellation is very noticeable. i have also had some issues connecting back to my phone each time but it is very easy to reconnect, so it's not much of a problem. overall, i would say this is a great product and would highly recommend it.",3056,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

bought these to use when walking my dog so i could listen to music - had trouble with airpods falling out of my ear - had to buy holders from other vendor since then work great,3328,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i love the quality and the loudest of the airpods, definitely worth it.",3329,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"got these back when they were on sale. works very well with my phone. the case lasts for a long time, never ran out of power to charge them up. doesn’t block out sound too well but works alright as long as your not being yelled at or around heavy equipment. take full use of having one bud in while the other charges for long phone calls or using as a mic in gaming apps. every once in a while one of them becomes disconnected and won’t connect back but unpairing and repairing fixes the issues. they tend to last two to three hours after a full charge after heavy use. i do recommend to apple users after trying out four other brands of true wireless headphones. not much for bass but just enough to hear it bump.",3330,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i feel like the fact that these don’t charge wirelessly should be very prominent in the description of these. i really like the sound quality and the comfort but i bought these almost a year ago and assumed when it said they were 2nd gen that they could charge wirelessly.,3358,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"made the purchase for my son. he uses how ipods for social media, music and his virtual learning. like any child’s he can sometimes misplace them, cost makes them easier to replace when lost. the fact  that i can replace them if lost or damaged if i add them to my apple coverage with my other devices reduces my cost when they do have to be replaced. more often then not  lower cost items cannot be insured.",3360,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i’m sure some of these good and bad reviews are fake. i’m a real account giving a real reviewer as a regular amazon shopper. i am no paid reviewer and i’m someone who prides myself on helping others receive the best clarity possible when it comes to you all spending your money so i have your back. have no fear. a real reviewer is here! loli purchased 2nd generation airpods a year ago in atlanta from best buy. i lost them. i was skeptical purchasing through amazon when it comes to airpods but they are a third party seller, just like best buy of course so it’s no difference. honest review =  i saw 400,000 good reviews and a few thousand that were in the bad. the good outweighed the bad. i purchased the $29 warranty because, why not? i didn’t before - and lost them lol so i’m not making that mistake again.i just received them. pretty quickly too. overnight. received by 8-9am the next morning.the sound quality, the charger, the case, = so far everything’s really good. ! i am pleased with my purchase. one of my favorite features is even when i’m not near my phone, but i have the airpods in - it’ll ask me to read my message through my ear and i can also reply. which comes in handy. it’s very clear and loud.if anything changes? i’ll return to edit but if you don’t see an edit? it’s no issue. purchase them. as far as android users? come on. let’s use our basic common sense here. these are apple product airpods for apple products. of course you’re going to have certain issues for your device when it’s by samsung ok? lol i see most of the bad reviews were android users so i was utterly perplexed.jamming out to my airpods as i prepare to do my dishes. do it. i’m the angel in your ear saying do it, but it. to the android users, babes don’t buy it lol love you all have a blessed day and be kind to others. law of attraction guys, is absolutely real. trust so be kind today! muah",3743,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

,3813,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
came fast and as advertised,3814,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
this is the second time i’ve bought these air pods. i love them! very good quality and comfortable. they fit my ears very well snd don’t fall out. the price was also very reasonable for the quality. it came in nice sealed box and brand new. the battery lasts really long on the case. i don’t charge it every day. depends on how much i use them but can generally go a few days without charging case. when wearing these i can pretty much hear when someone talks to me yet they are good enough that i can hear what i’m listening even if someone in room is watching tv. to me i would not want 100% noise cancelling because that doesn’t seem safe to me. i like that i can control them on the pod itself or my phone. i’m very pleased with my purchase and would buy them a third time if needed. i feel no need to buy newer air pods with very little features i don’t get with these. i recommend to my brother and he bought some fir himself and our mother and they love them as well. my son also has them and is very happy with them. highly recommend these! the price is half what the newest air pods are but the quality is not. excellent quality and price.,3815,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i love this product and i use it every day.  for work i answer phone calls and i am very happy with the quality of both the sound i hear and the clarity of my voice to the people i talk to.  i often listen to audible books on tape while walking or running and it is very easy to use.  i prefer these to the more expensive product offered by apple because it does not cancel all the external sound.  i think it is safer to be able to hear adequately the sounds around you.  especially when exercising out side.  your hearing can save your life from unexpected hazards like cars or bikes coming down the road.  the sound quality is excellent.,3958,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i was a little hesitant to buy these airpods because of the reviews but i’m glad i did! i bought the new (wired) airpods ($89.99) there are no complaints other than the mic quality. i’ve tried recording voice messages, but they always come out muffled. everything was in it’s original packaging when it arrived and it actually arrived before the estimated delivery! the airpods themselves loses battery pretty quickly, but then again, you can just place them in the case for 5 minutes and return with at least 10-20 percent more! if you’re thinking about buying these, just buy it! you can always return it anyways.

"i use these at least daily (mainly for my morning walks) and so far, so good! the sound is decent and i enjoy the “touch” technology that is built in. i have my right ear set to next song and my left to siri which allows for an almost completely hands free experience once i get my playlist selected. these are a replacement to the first generation ones, which sadly went missing on a trip. i do feel that the first generation ones fit in my ears a bit better, but these still fit, just not as seemlessly. they are not noise canceling, but i need to be somewhat aware of my surroundings when walking so that’s fine with me! i did try a family member’s airpod pros and honestly, the fit was awful, so for me, especially with the black friday deal i got, these were the best option.",4419,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i like that it works flawlessly with my iphone. i don't know if it works with any other os.i like the sound quality. if you don't like the balance, you can always eq your music in the apple settings. bass-boost is pretty good at low volume, but i turn it off when i listen loud.i don't like the feel of the ear buds when laying down on them. i usually use in-ear when laying on my side so compared to that it feels uncomfortable.i don't like that you only get 1 option at a time for tap function (pause/play, next song, last song). i found that using the next button is best for the tap function because when you pull a bud out the music pauses.all and all its a great product and i don't see myself upgrading unless something bad happens.",4422,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"these wireless earbuds are amazing. they have a smooth connection to your phone and the possibilities of what they can assist you in, in your everyday life to make things easier are endless. they make listening to music, podcasts, phone calls, and talking to siri almost effortless. the 2nd generation apple airpods automatically connect to your phone through bluetooth first thing when you open the wireless charging case. the wireless charging case charges your airpods just by inserting them into their spots and closing the case. by charging your airpods in the case for just fifteen minutes you have up to 3 hours of battery life in each airpod. another feature that comes with the airpods is being able to customize certain things of the wireless earbuds to how you would like them. there are two ways you can customize them. the first one is by choosing what you'd like engraved on the case. the options of what you can engrave on them is limitless. some common things people engrave on them are their name, phone number in case they were to lose them, or a favorite quote. the other way you can customize them is by the name you want them under. when your airpods connect to your phone, it shows the name they are under on your phone screen and you can choose what you’d like that name to be. i love my 2nd generation apple airpods and i can’t say enough good things about them. if you are looking for a reliable wireless earbud, these are definitely for you.",4461,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

ok these are my first time having an airpods and i did some research of how telling if you get fake or real. the only way to know they are real once you connect to them and your name pops up when you connect and you see all the setting for the airpods and you see about the airpods. fake if you don't see the all the setting. so the airpods 2nd generation are real. i highly recommend buying this.,4604,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i got these for a good price on black friday - i never used earbuds much because they were uncomfortable and/or didn’t fit right. i’ve been using them every day since they arrived. the sound quality is good ‘nuf for me and i like the fit. i’m a little concerned that some people had problems with them not working after a short time so i will update if that happens. so far so good!,4611,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i actually like these earbuds and feel that they fit comfortably in my ears. i have super small ear canals and the earbuds that fit in my ears never fit comfortably. i downloaded an app that enables me to get my calls and to hang up by tapping the earbuds (as if i had an iphone). i've been pleased with the sound quality and those who are on the other end of my calls have noted that the call quality is really good. battery life could be better but overall all this is a good purchase for sure!,4764,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i didn't know if these were worth the money considering that these seemed like glorified regular earbuds. i actually like these better. while the price is high, it seems worth it in my couple months of owning them. i got these for my first semester at college to ignore people and listen to bomb ass music without looking too broke. first off, these are pretty good with noise canceling. i can hear people sometimes if the music is low enough, but the sound is more muffled. it is great when i want to pay attention to my work or ignore people as they tune out people and they also make it a universal sign of ""don't talk to me"" which is great when i don't want to talk to others in public. even if i'm not listening to music! the other great thing is the fact that it's quick to charge and the battery life is pretty good!in comparison to regular earbuds or even headphones is the fact that they are easy to pack and easy to access. headphones are bulky and generally awkward (for me at least) to have around the neck. however, airpods are really easy to put in and then when you are done using them, you put them back in the small compact case. another is the lack of wire. i don't know about you, but for me the lack of wire is much easier. when i am in the mood to listen to something with my earbuds, i no longer need to un-knot the earbuds but simply take them out of the case. so like i said, i really like these and enjoy the easy access and the small compactness of this as well as the increase in sound quality and battery life. if i could rate this out of 10, i would give it an honest 10.",4765,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

the only reason i gave in and bought air pods was because i was having issues connecting my apple devices to other brands. these are hassle free changing between devices. on the downside they are very uncomfortable on the ear took me 2 months to get use to them. currently having issues with left air pod sometimes won’t connect. battery life is ok i’ve had cheap ones that last way better.,4777,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"first of all. upon receiving the package it was thrown on the ground in front of my building , this is a shared building with 3 different homes. the package was no where near my front door and the bag was ripped open to a point where you could see the contents inside. i just so happen to go out for a jog when it arrived. besides that, they work great ! they’re great for running, sometimes they slip out of my ear though. sounds great, i use them every day. i suggest buying a case for them right away , because they get scratched up really easily.",4913,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i only use them for studying/classes as a college student and battery last almost a full week! other than studying/classes i use my wired earphones. definitely worth the price if your looking for good wireless earphones and reasonable price if you are in my shoes where the wire bothers with studying and online classes. only reason why its not a 5 star is because  i do see some battery difference in the left airpod and sometimes left disconnects but nothing a good restart can fix. great sound quality!,4969,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"a great price on this unit was the main reason for getting the airpods.  apple's reputation for quality products was another reason.the sound is terrific and the units charge quickly in the case.  the case itself also holds a charge well and re-energizes fast.unlike some units, these rely on the iphone or ipad to adjust the sound level rather than using a tap or touch to do that.  that really isn't a negative unless a user is more familiar with that method.  great buy!",4982,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"like that ear pods allow the freedom to move around vs being restricted by wires with earbuds.  sound quality is not as crisp as i thought it would be and inconvenient that the volume needs to be adjusted on the  phone.  as a suggestion, it would be less cumbersome if the volume could be adjusted via the ear pods.",5064,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i had a problem with one of the airpods in that i dropped it in the middle of the street and didn't realize i had dropped it until it had been run over by a car. i called apple support and they exchanged it even though it was clearly my own stupidity that caused the damage. customer service win!  thank you!!,5065,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i love this product and it worked flawlessly until a few days ago. apparently airpods are only designed to work for 1 year. i purchased these on 10/14/20 and they just stopped charging. disappointed in apple as i expected them to last for longer than 1 year. i had thought about buying the more expensive version, but after this, i will be exploring options with aftermarket suppliers.",5239,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i'm 68. hearing is still quite good. after using these for 2 weeks on my 3 mile daily walk, they needed a charge. after charging over nite, the left bud did not work. a little back story needed here: i threw out 5 other sets of 'like' buds, after same occurrence. this is my second set of airpods after returning first set to store, for same problem. i decided there must be a problem with left-bud, not setting all the way down in the case for charging. i found a way to ""vertically"" charge while charging in the case. success! i put in the left-bud first, to insure connection & yellow lite appears, then the right-bud. worked good so far. good luck to you too.",5249,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i purchased these to sync with a gps mapping app on my phone.  the app is intended for cycling applications. after setting up my route the app gives me turn by turn instructions while riding.  the air pods ensured that i never missed a turn over several days of cycling in both urban and rural settings.the buds are comfortable to wear and remain very secure in my ears even while exerting myself on a bike and perspiring in hot weather.,5252,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"they are perfect, they sound better than cable headphones and the reception is incredible. it also has functions that i have only seen in these headphones, like if you take off one of the headphones the music pauses, and if you put it on again it continues.the bad thing is that the battery lasts very little and they have to be constantly charging but the good thing is that it charges very fast.finally, they feel very light but the case feels very fragile so i recommend buying a case.",5275,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"for me, i've always been looking for wireless headphones that fit my ears, and don't fall out. i am quite an active person, so i use the apple airpods almost everyday. they're fit snug in my ear and never fall out no matter what exercise i am doing.the battery life on these are also great! i think i charge my airpod case twice a week because the battery life on it is so good. the airpods also charge very fast when in the case.the noise cancellation is what makes me give it a lower rating. i would have to increase the volume of music just to tune out whatever is happening in the environment around me. (if you're looking for an apple product that has better noise cancelation, i recommend the airpods pro, but the downside is that they cost roughly $200)overall, very good airpods for its price of ~$130 (tax included)!",5280,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i got these as a gift from my daughters and could not be happier. the sound quality is great! i use them for phone hands free driving, multi tasking while on the phone, work calls etc. as well as for music. they sound great and the feedback from other callers is excellent as far as how i sound. i can hear the caller and my music perfectly and they have great dynamic range for music.  the noise cancellation issue is a trade off that i rated fairly at a 3 but that is not a negative. these fit loosely so that makes them extremely comfortable to wear and just about forget they're on for long periods of time. however, the fact that they are loose fitting does allow other noise to enter. this is a positive if you are in the car, have other people that may speak to you from time to time while you're wearing them etc. to me these are a great balance. i have another brand that i've had for years that fit really tightly and while they block out ambient noise they're also less comfortable and it's really hard to have them on while other people are around or you're needing to hear anything at all except the headphones. to me this is a great balance and i am extremely pleased with these!",5341,positive,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"good bt pairing and sound, but basically useless for any sort of activity because they fall out of your ears easily, especially when moving or sweaty.  even falling asleep with them on means you'll be searching through the bedding for the tiny pods when they fall out.  very strange that apple doesn't offer them with earhooks. haven't found an aftermarket earhook that fits properly or lets the pods charge with the hooks on.no way to adjust volume without taking the phone out of your pocket, at least with android phones.i'm returning them. high cool factor but terrrible on practicality.",5373,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i bought these apple airpods on this amazon site and gave them as a gift.  they stopped working completely after 6 months.  i called apple with the serial number and they said they had been manufactured in two years prior and probably had been returned to amazon and resold.  they were sold as brand new.  i will never buy apple products on amazon again - only buy them from apple.  it may be an easier purchase but you are not getting what you are paying for.,5416,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"got these to replace a first gen airpod and they came in quickly but that’s where the pleasant experience ended. trying to connect was a nightmare and when they finally got connected they would not stay connected for more than 10 seconds at a time. after talking to amazon support and apple support for hours it was finally determined that this had been sitting on a shelf for a long time because the firmware was out of date and because they wouldn’t stay connected to the phone they could not be updated. fine i guess i need to exchange them on amazon but apparently you can’t do that, you have to return them and wait for a credit and then buy them again. oh did i mention when returning them you can’t just drop them off at kohls like other things.. no that would be too easy, you have to have ups pick them up and an adult has to be home at the time of pickup so i am actually having to take a day off of work to send these back. i usually buy everything on amazon but this experience will definitely have me thinking twice next time.",5426,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"real airpods are 5 stars, but amazon is filled with fake airpods, and the ones i received weren't obvious. i saw a review here of someone who had trouble with their new airpods, brought it in to apple for fixing, and the apple repair team concluded it was a high quality knockoff. turns out i'm a victim as well.it's like someone gutted a real pair of airpods, replaced the internals with cheap knockoffs and put it back together. everything with my ""airpods"" was identical and seemed brand new. plastic wrap was around the oem box (pretty easy to fake nowadays, but still impressive nontheless). everything was immaculate just like a new box of airpods, oem feeling cable, etc. the feel, touch, glue, placement of holes and patterns of the airpods seemed identical to my older airpods.1. the biggest clue was audio quality. the audio quality was considerably worse than regular airpods. it was noticeable right off the bat, especially when talking with other people. it was especially obvious since i still have my old gen 2 airpods to compare with.2. bluetooth was very unstable. leaving more then 6 feet away from my bluetooth adapter made it go haywire and produced a lot of static. it would also randomly go offsync with the left and right earbuds when listening with both of them on.3. battery life. they lasted about 2-3 hours before the battery died on them. not much else to say about this, just way lower battery life than new airpods should have.interesting thing to note, the apple limited warranty should not be used as a metric to see if it's legit. the first thing i checked was to see if these fake airpods had warranty, which it said i had 1 year starting from the day i paired it with my iphone 9/22/22. i thought this assured me that i had a legit pair of airpods. once i concluded the new airpods were fake, i did some testing and all i did was put my real old airpods with the new fake airpod charging case, and now my old airpods purchased in 2019 said i have 1 year of warranty starting on 9/22/22.conclusion: buyer beware, high effort airpods seem to plague amazon. if you want to save ~$25 bucks and roll the dice get these on amazon. if you don't want to take the risk of dealing with this headache, just buy it directly off apple.",5463,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i ordered these on prime day from amazon. the pro was i received them within hours of ordering.the con, as with many name brand items on amazon i’m not sure why the quality you get on amazon is always so much different than what you get at actual large retailers but it’s always a different quality. one of the buds wouldn’t pair automatically nor did it make a sound letting me know it was connected. troubleshot the pod with amazon tech support and then it started working but the other went out. long story short, purchase from apple or target or maybe even walmart.as for the pods themselves, i would recommend getting the pro. these are cute and stylish and you can listen to music or videos or whatever but there is zero noise cancellation. like zero. i got them mainly for work so when i’m working i can tune out noise but absolutely no, i can hear everything around me. they fit well and the overall sound quality is good for what’s it’s worth but they are not the best by any means. they are convenient. i think the battery is pretty good. they stay in place. but if you’re looking for the best sound or noise cancelling, skip these. if you’re looking to save a little money but want a good quality bluetooth earbud set by a trusted brand then get these. don’t waste your money on the $20-40 no names cause they typically don’t fit well and have connectivity issues.",5578,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"the sound quality is just fine. i like the ease of function by tapping. and i like how quickly they charge. only about 30 mins for another 4 to 5 hours use. but i have two main issues with these. i use mine at work all day. i have them in on average of 6 to 8 hours a day. i found that after that amount of usage, it wasn’t long before the hard plastic made my ears extremely sore. there were times i couldn’t use them because they hurt my ears too much. i realize i probably use them more than the average person. second, the mic stopped working just a few days after my warranty expired. that was a total bummer. i could no longer use them for voice calls. all that said, i do like apple products. i purchased the pros with extended warranty. hopefully i fare better with them.",5579,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"overall, sound is fine. they’re just earbuds so i don’t expect audiophile levels of sound quality or any noise cancellation. but for an apple product, these things have far too many bugs for their price.these things are terrible outdoors or in very large spaces. they will cutout and disconnect, because i’m assuming the signal is too weak and doesn’t have anything to bounce off of. that makes them basically useless for the outdoors or in wide open spaces, like large atriums or gyms. i can really only expect to use these in the home or office, which meant i had to buy another pair of headphones that worked outdoors. it’s a bit ridiculous.speaking of home and office use, the mic does not work well at all, and is unusable for phone calls, video/zoom calls, etc. so again, i have to switch to a headset or my other pair of headphones for that, since people cannot hear me if i attempt to use these.on top of that, they also have issues with ear detection and randomly disconnecting from my iphone. i’ll be wearing them, listening to whatever, and suddenly they just drop the connection, as if i took them out of my ear. the only way to get it working again is to place it back into the case and take them out again and place them back in your ear. it’s very annoying and happens almost every time i use them.i’ve used two pairs since 2018, and both have had these issues. i’ve only used them with other apple products, multiple iphones and an ipad, so i know it’s not a device compatibility or bluetooth issue.my oldest pair has almost no battery life left, and is only useable for less than an hour at a time, so don’t expect these things to last more than a few years either.in conclusion, these have always felt like a step backward from a classic pair of wired earbuds. sure, they’re wireless, but it just feels so much less usable in so many different ways, while being 10 times the cost. apple needs to seriously step up their wireless earbuds game if they insist on moving away from wired connections and forcing us to use the garbage pods.",5825,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
why these are $130 is beyond me. unusable. horrible sound quality too. less usable range than apple ear buds,5826,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"bought these airpods in april and i really enjoyed using them, but i had accidentally lost them while on a bikeride when i had them in my pocket. i lost them somewhere on the road and when i got home, i noticed they were gone. i tried tracking them using the findmy app and the airpods couldn't connect to my phone, because you need to open up the airpods to get an updated tracking location, which defeats the purpose of even having the tracking feature to find them because you have to open them to even get a location for them. with the insane $120 price tag i don't think i'll be buying new airpods again, i'll probably go with a better brand for a cheaper price.",5834,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"it has been quite a while since i've bought a set of apple earbuds to use as my primary form of listen-wear. i truly miss the design of the apple earbuds from the pre-2010 ipod days. i used the heck out of them as a kid, and thought the 2nd generation airpods would hopefully be the closest thing to that. for me, they aren't...sound quality is as good as i always thought the apple headphones were, nothing really lost there.battery life is fantastic, though admittedly, i haven't really charged them since i initially charged them when i first got them and it's been several days (not continuous use)...so...take that for what it's worth...comfort is the absolute biggest miss here. you have to shove these things down into your ear to get optimal hearing and my ears are not a fan of that. if you look up the external parts of the ear, the ""helix crus"" part of my outer ear is so irritated that once i take the airpods out, there's no way they are going back in. (so just leave them in then)....well...that's not always possible, and because they hurt so much, i find myself trying to adjust to make them more comfortable, and that just doesn't work.(so get some earbud cushions....) got 'em...i got a whole pack of 20 or so from amazon that people were adamant would make the airpods more comfortable based on their own experience......didn't work. you could say in some regard that they helped to some degree, but they definitely didn't take away the uncomfortability of the  airpods, and if it doesn't eliminate the comfort issue completely, they might as well not even be there...(could it just be your ears....?) yes, it absolutely could just be my ears. ears come in all different sizes and some may not even notice these things are in their ears - that's what i was hoping for...but sadly didn't achieve. perhaps if there was a smaller pair, the discomfort may not be such a problem, but obviously that's illogical.i also had an issue with getting the sound to play on them from my phone. bluetooth was enabled, airpods were showing as ""connected"", but the sound wouldn't switch from my phone speaker to the airpods. i can't remember what all i had to do in order to finagle that....but it took some doing, and no other non-apple product that i've ever used has had this issue...and if you research it, it sounds like it's a common issue with no real straight-forward resolution.it's truly a shame. i could have done with lesser quality sound and even poorer battery life in exchange for greater comfort. apple hits the mark on just about everything here except that one very important aspect, so buy at your own risk. i probably won't be using these the way that i thought i was going to be because of it...  $100 down...",5895,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
didn’t work out of the box.  after 2 hours of working with customer support they still wouldn’t work and they offered to send me parts to try to fix them or to take them to one of their stores to be repaired.  apple doesn’t stand behind their own products so i’m done with apple.  buy a quality product from a reputable company instead.,5896,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i had the first gen airpods for a long time but lost one of the ear buds. bought them from an apple store.purchased these online and they have little strange issues that my previous ones never had. they don’t “react” in the same way as my old ones. you can put them in your ear and that “i’ve sensed you’ve put me in your ear” sound doesn’t activate it all. i have to take it out and put it back in multiple times until it senses it. typically i have to get out the case and open and close it numerous times. put it back in the case. take it out. just play with it until it decides it’s good and ready to work. i never had this issue with my old ones. as soon i put them in, they work as they should. these ones- are garbage.secondly it doesn’t pick up when i open or close the case. typically when you do this, the battery percentage info will appear on your phone. maybe you have to do it a couple extra times but it will work quickly. these, rarely work. i can open and close to case over 20 times before the battery will appear on my phone. if it even appears at all. usually i just give up and plug it in.really disappointed in these. not sure why the quality is not the same as my old ones… that i’ve had for a looong time. something is wrong with these. are they authentic?",5925,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i’ve been having connectivity issues with my airpods for about 4 months now and i contacted them 2 months ago, i worked with apple support from the beginning of me realizing it was an issue— all the way from restarting network settings to sending my airpods in. they obviously fixed the issue when i sent them in, as the issue went away once the airpods were returned to me. to my surprise they stopped working within a week or two so i contacted them… again. this time to no avail, “raiza” said it was my phone and asked for me to try connecting airpods to other devices, as they “never found faulty issues when the technician worked with my airpods to try to fix them” (why was this never even communicated with me anyways, til i contacted them? communication issues?) mind you, i don’t have other devices to try airpods with, but i do have a jbl speaker i always connect to my phone with, and i never have connectivity issues with it, so i know for a fact the issue isn’t my phone! apple support really has trust issues, and don’t take their customer’s concerns seriously or professional because it wouldn’t be the case that she kept insisting it was my phones network settings and was also told her boss would tell me the same thing. she then proceeded to end session as i was typing. i’m astounded at apple customer service. maybe it’s a sign apple needs to spend more time either training or paying their employers more. or charge their customers more for the warranty? next time, i’ll remember to keep getting my devices through t-mobile, they are much more helpful when it comes to warranty and have never had issues replacing my damaged apple devices throughout the 7 years with them; plus—no delays and no rhetorical questions! thank you for stealing my money, apple.",5976,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i've had these airpods for over a year now. they are popular and it's easy to see why. initially the odd design with the white stems sticking out of a person's ear seems weird but is now more widely accepted. like the ipod ads of years past. apple did a fairly good job with these. these are good middle of the road earphones and provide okay sound quality. sound isolation is okay but it does not have noise cancellation. i think it's a bit more style over substance but sits overall somewhere in the middle.,6076,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

let me start by saying.. i love these earbuds. i’ve been a loyal apple customer since the first iphone came out. these earbuds have been the best ones i’ve owned yet. the only reason they’re getting one star is because of the battery life. the left ear is looses battery significantly quicker than the right and the case doesn’t hold a charge.  i’ve tried all the trouble shooting suggestions but they haven’t worked. the left side last for maybe 45 mins is down to 30% when the right side is at 95%.  super disappointed.,6113,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

edit: it has been a while now and amazon has not given my money back. it seems that the package hasnt really moved much. i don't know if ups lost my package or whatever but i don't know what to do nowit seems that the pair that i got was fake. i bought the 2nd gen which should have the green dot in the front but i recieved a full white case. i used the serial code for the airpods and put it in the apple website and they did not pop up. they don't sound bad though. i think it just depends when on luck whether you get a fake or a real one. but these reps are pretty good so i don't exactly know if ill return them because then again i only spent 100 on them for a sale,6118,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"let me start by saying our family buys lots of apple products. add that with the fact that having wireless earbuds are so convenient and apple appears to makes a slick product. the airpods fit fine for me and my spouse. the case is also very small, but the earbuds could have smaller stems. the sound quality is good, but not excellent. however, both sets we purchased had one earbud die within 1.5 years. i talked with a friend and they said the same thing happened to them. combine that with some negatives such as the high price, average battery life, the fact that these aren’t noise canceling, the annoyance that having a family sharing apple account combines all earbuds into everyones devices causing a lot of accidental switching of airplay, and you have a very expensive recurring cost per year per person. i thought about how a warranty might help, but you still have to pay for warranty plus the replacement parts and can only replace 2 parts. buying a new pair would have ended up being the same cost for us or even cheaper with the airpods on sale. maybe the gen 3’s will be more reliable but i’m not paying almost $200 to find out. my advice for most people, buy the off brands that come with an 18 month warranty and more features like double the battery life and controls. they will run as low as $30 and will probably be good enough. you can reward yourself with a music subscription using the money you’ll save.",6210,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i got these for free directly from apple and that's the only reason i have them. i knew i'd never buy these -- just from the looks of the all hard plastic design i knew they would be a poor fit, especially being that there is no silicone tip to stay gripped in the ears and to provide a good seal for the best sound possible. what i feared is exactly what i experienced when i got to use these.it integrates nicely with other apple devices, and is also able to connect to non-apple devices as well. sound is good with initial ear-seating, but it quickly loses seal and starts to fall out -- this is when i'm just sitting still. what's the point of having great technology if it cannot be used? also, what's with the lightning port instead of the standard usb when apple has so much concern over plastic waste? side note : the whole trend of eliminating headphone jacks and forcing customers to purchase wireless headphones and/or accessories to use existing headphones already owned by customers fully contradicts apple's advertised concern for waste reduction. all it does is it increases apple's profit with our money and takes away our choices. also now you have copycats like samsung and others doing the same -- end of side note.i guess since it has apple's name, too many people blindly rate 5 stars no matter what. i'll give them 5/5 stars for their marketing strategies. the price is just plain funny but i guess that is the new normal. the airpod pros are the practical choice if one was deciding on only airpods, but at that price it's a bit too much considering other available options.",6323,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

didn’t realize these were used. i bought some for christmas and they were brand new. not sure why this pair was out of box and charging case was scuffed. they also wouldn’t pair with my phone because they were broken. apple support was unable to help fix the problem. they are replacing them with a new pair.apparently these were refurbished which i didn’t know when i bought them. be careful buying refurbished.,6553,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"they were wonderful earbuds when i first got them, but after a while the sound quality was worse and one side stopped working. they didn’t work for phone calls and i would find that one earbud would be playing my music along with the phone playing music aloud. i finally retired them (after only having them for 6ish months) when they were blasting music in a library. it would be a better investment to buy a brand like tozo, but i will never be buying airpods again. this was my second pair in the last year (i treat my technology very well) and they are not worth it.",6592,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

the sound quality is similar to that of the wired apple earbuds but there was one problem in the right ear which was a buzzing sound. if there was no sound playing there was a faint buzzing sound. other people have commented on the same issue but besides that the airpods were okay. i'll be making sure to take it to the apple store to see if they can do anything about it with the 1 year warranty,6635,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
the ones that were delivered were not the 2nd gen. i had previously had the second gen but lost one of them so i ordered this pair. when they arrived i saw a couple things that were different then my previous ones. like where the button on the case was located was lower then on a 2nd gen as well as there was no light showing that it was charging on the outside. the sound quality sounds very muffled. i am scared to turn up the volume after the first time because of a very staticky sound that came from it that hurt my ears. i did get them while they said they were on sale but my recommendation is to actually buy from apple themselves.,6636,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
the battery life of the charger and the pods do not last as long as the first earpods i bought from apple. i’m not sure but it could possibly be a repair and re-sold. very disappointed,6637,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
don’t recommend. first off they are t 2nd gen airpods. the case wouldn’t charge at first. the case turned yellow a few days after owning. and the airpods would t charge properly  i had to hold them in a way for them to charge in the case. send me ones that aren’t broken and then i will change my review.,6638,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"my little 7 year old nephew wanted the first generation airpod for his birthday but his parents thought they were a waste of money, so i got them for him behind his parents' backs and he loves them.they operated well until approximately a month ago. at that point, the right earbud microphone started to malfunction and would no longer detect sound until he yelled. i phoned apple customer service and went over all of the possible remedies, such as upgrading to the most recent ios and checking that the airpods were running the most recent firmware. when customer service was unable to remedy the issue, they advised me to send the airpods in for repair. i received a fedex shipment box and label and made them an offer for repair. the airpods were returned to me approximately three days later, along with a message from the technicians claiming that there was nothing wrong with them.i then tested them on my phone and my wife's phone, and the right microphone on both phones would only detect sound at a very high volume, but the sound was still garbled. i phoned apple's customer service department once more. the representative advised that i take the airpods to the local apple store and explain the problem to a professional there. unfortunately, the nearest apple store was an hour away from my house, however the agent did not appear to find this to be an issue.i expressed my unhappiness with having to drive 2 hours round trip to fix a $130 equipment, and i inquired as to why i couldn't send them back for repair while determining the specific problem. the agent agreed to send another shipping box and note that the problem was with the right microphone on the repair ticket. i got another package, sent the airpods in for repair a second time, and waited. they gave them back to me and said there was nothing wrong with them. and, once again, the right microphone isn't working properly.at this point, i'm left wondering why the ""world's most valuable company"" would consider it appropriate to force a client to spend 3 hours of my time repairing apple's product rather than just shipping a new pair and keeping the consumer satisfied. apple's customer service has tarnished what might have been a fantastic device.",6660,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"used it good for1.2 years. good prompts from iphone, seamless connection but after the coverage expires my microphone stopped working. no benefit of getting it fixed because it cost more than the market price. when you go for repair, they don’t know what to fix, they just replace the ear piece.better to buy it with extended apple warranty.",6661,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i am unsure who ears apple had in mind when creating these ear buds. i like to think i have average, regular ears but these headphones make me feel like perhaps my ears are too small. i have to adjust the ear piece every few seconds so much so i had to buy one of the ear attachment pieces sold here on amazon just so the headphones don't fall out which coincidentally has happened. watching my $160+ airpods fall to the ground nearly broke my heart. aside from that the sound quality is fine... i can feel the bass. i hate the fact that there's a button now instead of the tap, tap feature the air pod second generation has. so i have to deal with the ear piece constantly trying to fall out, being shorter than the sec gen and now i have work to find this miniature button on the ear piece just to skip songs. listen to me sounding spoiled.... i'm at a cross. i was ""forced"" to buy these because my 2nd gen was staticky and everyone complained. i thought perhaps these being the newer gen they'd be greater. oh well!! at least people can hear me now!!",6670,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"overrated imo. sound quality is great, and obviously the novelty of how low profile they are is the best feature. however, the pairing technology/functionality is atrocious. forget about using them on a windows computer with bluetooth. jumbles and crosses wires with everything in the system. readjusts your mic settings, turns your volume up and down. total mess.and the worst part:randomly turns your volume to literal max on your phone when they automatically reconnect. can really f*** the rest of your day up and piss you off (at least for me).",6671,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"the sound quality seemed fine, but there is one thing that annoys me. the case creak! so what that means is that the top part of the case moves side to side slightly, and it started that the moment i peeled the seal off. they airpods also tend to fall out constantly, meaning that you constantly have to adjust them.  they are also not waterproof because… people seem to think that. overall they are a good buy, but if you just spent a little more for the third generation, it would take you a long way.",6676,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i actually own my own pair of airpods but i decided to gift a pair on someone’s birthday. the package was perfectly sealed and did not think to open it and check. it was in the moment of opening gifts where it was noticed that no airpods were found inside. it was an embarrassing moment for myself and i had to play it off as it was a cruel joke. had to put out more money. was going to order another pair but amazon somehow no longer had them? i don’t understand how i can refund something but there was no product in it. very disappointed.,6683,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

for the cost of these airpods they should have maximum performance but they barely have two hours talk time. they constantly fall out of my ear and also the battery drains super fast when you just have them sitting in your ear and not talking. i can deal with all of the other things but the barely two hours talk time is awful!  i spend more time charging them than actually talking on them. apple should be ashamed for creating such a poor quality product. i won’t ever buy them again.,6688,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"it’s on me for not returning this in the allotted time. but my wife bought these and she was never able to get them connected from day 1. upset, she threw them in a drawer hoping to have me get to it later. we found them recently and i tried everything to connect them. say with apple support for over an hour. while they were very helpful the conclusion was that it is a hardware issue as if someone may have connected them before our ownership and broken them before the sale to me. anyway, again we take the hit for letting time slip by, but to buy a high priced product that never works from the beginning really sucks.",6816,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"scam!!!!! these were not new. not even close. they were originally bought 1,457 days ago. found this out when i had to call apple support because when i received them the left side never worked. they said to fix them would be $145 because they were out of warranty…. that’s how i found out how very old they truly were. i’m livid. so much for that christmas present for my son",6817,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"had these for a year and the right one stopped working. did my research, read all the articles on how to fix them. still right one doesn’t work. contacted apple and they told me i could buy a new pair. why would anyone buy another pair !?!garbage for the amount you pay and lack of customer service buy something else",6818,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

very disappointed with this apple product. had it for two years and didn’t think of buying the extended warranty as you’d think with the name of “apple” it meant american even though made in china. nope just another chinese pos product. thanks apple for taking my money in me buying this one of a kind worthless junk novelist item. so appreciative. but lived up to the standards of its other products living vicariously through them such as their phones lasting about two years. criminal.,6832,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"even though i’m sure to keep my airpods clean, after a year, so much earwax has been jammed into the airpods that audio is significantly quieter. not worth the money. no noise cancellation which is pretty standard at the end of 2021. battery is great. the airpods last for a long time but the case starts to deplete faster as you use them. the microphone is horrible. if i had a dollar for everytime i was told i couldn’t be heard, i would probably have airpods pro’s anyway. i feel there are better options than these. if you want to spend some extra money, the airpods pro’s are a good choice. silicone tips (which would prevent the earwax issue), great noise cancellation, better microphones, recent. conclusion is, they’re great for about a year but unless you don’t produce earwax, they start to get quieter.",6837,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i bought these so i could listen to music while out on walks with my dog and zoom calls. after using them for a few months, i have some thoughts on this. i have a pair of over the head headphones that are noise cancelling. they were cheap relative to the air pods and they deliver great sounds when i play music on them. the airpods were only okay at 3x the price of the headphone. they don't fall out of my ear while walking or jogging as some people have reported, but if i go to tuck my hair behind my ear or rest my head on something, they fall out because of the long tail it has on them. the airpod pro looks like it would sit better in your ear and not get easily knocked out since it has a much shorter tail. all that said, i tried cheaper blue tooth ear pods and they were terrible and kept disconnecting from my phone so i gave this 3 stars because the sound is good enough for walks and stays connected to the bluetooth.  the battery life for using it for calls is pretty short (around 2 hours) but i've never run the battery out on them listening to music. the wireless charging case recharges them very fast and i consider that a huge plus. the airpod pro is likely much better but i'd still buy these over the airpod 2 just because of the huge price difference.",6842,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"these worked great! sound quality, seamless connection, connection stability, and stayed in my ear during 10 mile bike rides. the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because i returned them to upgrade to airpods pro for better noise cancellation and it took amazon 16 days to refund my money. amazon didn't alert me that my refund had gone through. i found out because i ordered a book from kindle and the cost  was free because of a discount. then i ordered the airpods pro and the remaining discount was applied. as of today my account still says they are working on it. i will say this though, this is the first time i've had a problem with a return.",7092,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i've been using some cheaper options, but decided to upgrade to the real deal. i've seen people using these in tv interviews and figured they must be the best.unfortunately, for my uses, which are mostly recorded video interviews via zoom, etc., the microphone was awful. versus a cheapo $30 lav mic, the mic on the buds sounded very muffled. no crispness on the high frequencies at all. worst of all, people could not hear me on the other end. the output volume for the mic was extremely low versus everything else i've used. i tried adjusting the audio settings in zoom and other programs, but still no good even at 100% volume.maybe it sounds great when used with iphone or an apple device (i don't know), but performance when paired with my windows 10 laptop was too poor for my uses. it paired fine and i could hear fine but the muffled, low-volume microphone was a deal breaker for me.",7231,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

they sent used airpods. not just slightly used. i could have dealt with slightly used. these still had ear crust all over them. also had something crusty in the plug in port. if i wanted used airpods i would have found some from marketplace. now i have to wait another 10 days for hopefully a good replacement! great job amazon.,7242,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

airpods are not what i was expecting. the only good thing about them is how many hours they last and noise cancellation! but the sound quality is bad. one airpod can only last more than another and you can’t even here much when you balance the sound qualities of both airpods. earpods can last longer than these things. a whole waste of $100. they’re a rip off.,7305,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"the sound quality would be great if the left ear bud didn’t constantly cut inn and out. not worth $120. find a cheaper pair, you'll at least get what you pay for.",7306,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"first the good- sound quality and ease of use are amazing. yes, this was a genuine apple product, i verified the serial number before i opened the box. they connected to my phone right away, no weird extra steps to pair. they sound amazing. they are not noise canceling- i thought that wouldn’t be as big of a deal as it is. now for the reason i’m upgrading to the pro model- the fit is awful. the right airpod hurts my ear after only a few minutes of use. the pro model has more fit options and noise cancellation. i am glad that i tried these because they are by far the easiest bluetooth ear buds i’ve ever used, the sound is great, and if they fit better i’d be 100% sold. so there you go. give them a try for sure, but once you do, you may want the better set. and get apple care. i work on the repair side of things and we send them out all the time. i would not think to get these without the added protection.",7307,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i purchased my airpods almost 2 years ago. at first they worked great but the common faulty problems of the right airpod not charging or holding a charge is a major problem for such a high price tag.  also if you don’t have the most recent update only one will work for some odd reason.there will be multiple times i put the airpods in the case and when going to use them would only get sound from the left. this seems to be a larger problem since the internet community all mention the same problem.i replaced them with the bose airpods and so far just great. if you can live without siri speaking every text message to you i would go that route and save the money,7321,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"1 star because although they are amazing, i'm now on my 4th pair in 4 years.i bought my airpod 2nd gen directly from apple (not on amazon).  my first pair had the microphones go out, but i didn't realize it until just after the 12 month warranty expired.  i just thought siri sucked and couldn't figure out what i was asking.  had i realized it was a microphone issue in time, i would have been under warranty.  however, when i finally realized the microphones fully quit working, they wouldn't replace them (days past warranty).  soon after this the speakers on one side started going out.  i had to adjust the iphone sound settings to have less sound go to one ear so they balanced out and then up the volume.  at this point i decided i'd get a new pair because i use them all the time and need sound and microphones working.so, i bought a second pair.  fast forward several months and the microphones quit working on this pair.  this time i call for warranty asap.  they checked things over with me and replaced them.  to apple's credit, it was single day shipping and quick turnaround.so, onto my third pair.  about 3-4 months in with my third pair, the microphones quit working.  wth.  i am so careful with these things and have no clue how or why this could possibly be happening.  i was so busy working at the time i waited to contact support (thought the new pair would have typical 1 year functional warranty expectations).  well i was wrong there.  spent a long time with apple support and learned that the replacements are only covered for the remainder of your original pairs warranty (or 90 days if your previous pair were under that time remaining).  so, they only guarantee the replacements will function properly for the time remaining on your previous product warranty?  i get that they don't want people seeking a brand new product every year through minor warranty claims, but what if the replacement product legit fails in a short period of time?after being escalated to senior support staff at apple and some more discussions, they ultimately agreed to make an exception and provide me a warranty replacement pair.  sent them in and they confirmed the issue and replaced quickly.  again, quick turnaround with warranty shipping.so, onto my fourth pair.  everything works great, but it's only been a few days.i love the airpods.  they sound great.  i prefer earbuds that don't ""plug"" my ear and these fit my ears well.  only real issues have been those mentioned above.  another issue has been battery life.  it's great when they are newer.  normally, they notify you when they are running low several times before powering off.  as they get older, i'll get that low battery sound and then they immediately shut down.the airpods have amazing reviews and ratings by thousands, so i'm shocked i can't find anyone else having issues with microphones like i am.  they are great when they work, but i've had tough luck getting them to work correctly for more than a year.update on 4th pair... less than 3 months into the 4th pair and people were occasionally having trouble hearing me in conversations.  i isolated the left vs right mic in the settings and figured out the the right airpod microphone is going out (distant soft sound and cutting in and out).  didn't notice earlier because the left still works fine and it must autoselect that mic most of the time.  called apple and looks like i'm still in the 90 day warranty on replaced items (thankfully i caught it in time), so it looks like i may be able to get the right one replaced.  will have to again send the entire case and both airpods into their service center first to have them checked.i put these in my ears.  i put them back in the case.  i really don't understand how each pair could keep having this issue.",7370,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"after a week the airpods kept disconnecting from my iphone 7. i had to have the device leave bluetooth and completely restart. before that, the left side would play music but it would not respond to the double tap nor to the motion to automatically start the airpods/turn them off when taken out of the ear.  i will return and re-order, give it another try since i really like them aside from this issue.update receiving my replacement airpods: i want to start by saying i am fairly text savvy and know how to work with my iphone having used other bluetooth devices with it. this new set of airpods still has issues with consistency: it can take forever for the airpods to link up with my phone. the tap modes such as pause and fast forward work infrequently. it is hard to believe that there is a single digit percentage of problems like these on all of the reviews that i see, because this is my second pair and i am still having issues. i can get by without having to use the double tap modes, i can just use my phone, but the delayed wireless hook up to the phone is just unacceptable. since i have tried other brands of wireless these seem to have the best sound and are the most comfortable. but if you don’t mind using a different wireless buds that stick directly in your ear, then skip apple and get those.so disappointed but keeping them anyway.",7504,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
my right airpod went out within 6 months of purchasing. i purchased the 2 year protection plan with the airpods from amazon and when i reached out to apple to repair/replace they wanted me to pay full price for a new pair due to the product being outdated not covered under the protection plan.,7505,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

fairly pathetic for the money.  can't change volume or skip songs.  double tap is the only function and that only pauses the music.  i keep my ipod in a arm band.  short distance from upper arm to my ears and the earpods cannot maintain a signal if i turn my head.  give me my money back.,7514,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"as usual, apple adopts the most scuzzy business practices and makes each set of air pods uniquely connectable to the iphone so that when you lose one air pod the whole set is useless with the new set. shame on you apple! shame on you for using quasi-criminal business tactics to make more profits you don't need, at the expense of your customers!",7539,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"my wife purchased these for me as a gift in august 2020 and they worked great up until about a month ago.  at that time, the right ear bud microphone began to fail and would no longer detect sound unless i was yelling.  i contacted customer support at apple and worked through all of the potential resolutions such as updating to the newest ios (14.6) and confirming that the airpods were running the most recent firmware.  when customer support was not able to resolve the issue they suggested that i send the airpods in for repair.  i received a shipping box and label for fedex and sent them offer for repair.  the airpods arrived back at my home about 3 days later with a note from the technicians stating that there was nothing wrong with them.  i then tested them again on my phone and my wife's phone, and with both phones the right microphone would only detect sound at a loud volume (i.e. yelling) and yet still garbled.  again i contacted customer support at apple.  this time the agent suggested that the next step would be to take the airpods to the nearest apple store so that i could demonstrate the issue for a technician there.  unfortunately the nearest apple store is 2.5 hours from my home, though this did not seem to be an inconvenience in the eyes of the agent.  at this point, i stated that it did not make sense to drive 5 hours round-trip to repair a $130 device, and i questioned why i could not send them back for repair while identifying the exact issue.  the agent agreed to send another shipping box and to include on the repair ""ticket"" that the issue was with the right microphone.  so... (can you guess where this is going?) i received another box, sent the airpods a 2nd time for repair, and waited.  again, they returned them to me and stated that nothing was wrong with them.  and again, the right microphone still does not function correctly.  at this point i am left wondering why the ""world's most valuable company"" would find it acceptable to ask a customer to take 5 hours of his/her time to fix apple's product, instead of simply sending a replacement pair and keeping the customer happy.  apple's product support has ruined what could be a great product.",7564,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"do not buy these unless you have an iphone.  there is no way to increase the volume above a library level of quiet, even turned all the way up.  i brought them to the gym and the waterbottle rattling in my elliptical machine's cupholder was louder than my music.  there was zero noise cancellation.  i tried every online ""hack""  and workaround in the book and changed so many phone settings that i wound up turning my google pixel into a flashing strobe light screen which had to be factory reset (lost all my data.)  if you enjoy volume and have an android do not buy.  literally anything but these unless you plan to frequent places where you can hear a pin drop like the library.",7565,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"this product has been nothing but trouble. first, the right earpiece is louder than the left, and there is no way to adjust this. at least i don't think there is: it came without any directions at all. a great deal of time on the internet found no solution.  there are no actual buttons, it is ""touch"" control, which means any time you adjust its position in your ear it turns itself off, or the volume changes, or it pauses whatever your listening to.  lately, the left earpiece turns itself off spontaneously, without being touched, after a few minutes. if you can manage to communicate that you want it turn back on, it will turn back on for - sometimes - up to an entire minute.  if the two earpieces become unsynced, the only way to get them both back is to stop what you're doing, place them back in the case, and remove them again. and no, they are fully charged.  it's not just that the device is fractious. it is designed poorly, since it is not obvious how to control it through various touch patterns and again, there were no directions included.

i bought a used “good” condition pair of airpods from the amazon warehouse for my little cousin’s birthday and they are a mess😂. it’s laughable these are “good” condition they look bad like old and used. i tried to connect them to my iphone to se if they worked since i’m gonna paint them anyway so could sea with them being not good looking but one of them didn’t even work. sending them back and just gonna pay the extra $30 for a brand new pair. at least amazon had brand new ones at a good price,7780,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i've owned airpods before, so i'm fairly familiar with the sound quality and the sensitivity of the microphone. but within a week of using my new pair of airpods, i knew something was off. people i speak to on facetime tell me that my voice is almost indistinguishable and that it's very high pitch. this morning, i decided to test it by recording myself saying something: the difference is night and day.i'm not sure if i was sent a defective unit or whatnot, but i'll have to return them and try another brand.",7781,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

there is a serious deteriorating bluetooth connection issue with iphone (11 pro). it becomes more and more common after half year of use that iphone shows the airpods are connected but the sound still goes to speaker; or there is no sounds in either airpods or speakers. it's unclear what's the issue. i typically have to try turn the bluetooth on and off several times before it's back to normal state.,7837,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"as most apple products are, these work pretty well. i know this isn't the case for everyone, but these fit in my ears perfectly and comfortably. i can wear them for hours at a time without noticing them. i've been using these with an android phone with some interesting results.things i love about them:- how quickly they connect. these things connect almost immediately once you open the lid for the case!- you can use either one on their own if you want, it doesn't matter which- the call quality is fantastic! i love taking calls on these things!- the range is pretty great. i can set my phone down and walk around nearby rooms most of the time without any issue.things i don't love:- the audio quality is alright. it's about the same as the wired earpods. not bad, but nothing amazing.- it's too easy to hear what's going on around me. they have no noise cancellation whatsoever. i could literally carry on full conversations with people while listening to these if i wanted.- connectivity issues. the range is usually good, but sometimes the connectivity is awful. i can walk around with my phone in my pocket and put my hand over my phone, and these will skip in and out. sometimes they'll even get out of sync a little bit. this has happened extensively. i made a warranty claim on them and apple said they couldn't find any problems so they sent them back, and i still have those issues. i also wonder how much this has to do with my phone though, because my phone (samsung galaxy s9) bluetooth doesn't seem the strongest sometimes.if you have an iphone, i'd recommend giving them a go. but i think there are definitely better deals out there.",7861,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i’ve tried a variety of earbuds, i finally broke down and bought the airpods but i don’t feel like they are worth it. i mean they’re fine, but they don’t work well for running... they don’t fall out but moisture (sweat) causes them to to disconnect because their sensors malfunction, i don’t know if that’s just me and it’s not like my ears are actually sweating inside it’s just sweat coming from my head. they don’t have the functions that other earbuds have (like tap for next/pause/volume) and the stress of worrying about losing them is overwhelming! they’re perfectly fine for walking and sitting and i often find that i forget i have them in because they’re relatively comfortable. but it’s easy to knock them out and if you lay down they can shift and “disconnect” again because the sensors aren’t touching your ear on both sides of the earbud. if you think you can use these earbuds and wear earmuffs at the same time (ear protection for loud machinery) think again! the lightest touch can knock one out then your audio stops and you’re left with an earbud in the earmuff. the noise cancellation is fine, i’m a female who generally only has one in at a time for safety reasons, and the sound is fine. i’ve had better sound from cheaper earbuds. im sure all of these things are unique to the user, maybe my ears are weirdly shaped, maybe i sweat more than most people. it just doesn’t feel like they’re worth the money. on a positive note, they’re great for phone calls.",7907,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"when i first bought this i was super excited, when the package showed up, there was nothing in my box, i contacted amazon and apple right away. amazon was willing to send me a replacement, which was really nice. then, when i got that package, the airpods didn't work. i let it charged for over two days before using, i tried setting it up on my iphone xr which literally took over 30 mins for it to sync, then when it finally synced i couldn't hear out of the left airpod, so then i unsynced it and had to go through the whole 30 min process again, and then i decided to get it another day with charging, and then they both worked for about 2 seconds and then it started to get static and the right one stopped working. now, i have to send my product back to apple for them to repair it. honestly, save your time and either buy it at a big store. don't buy through amazon.",7908,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i finally made the switch to airpods from my 2016 jabra elite 65t and it most certainly been a downgrade.  here are my reasons for feeling so:1. battery life is atrocious.  with daily use i would charge my jabra's once a week.  they had excellent battery life and the charge case was great with keeping them ready to go.  with my airpods i have to charge daily.  full being fully charged i took them on an hour bike ride and maybe used sporadically throughout the day and by night i had the warning of only having 5% battery, after being in the case.2.  sound quality is mediocre.  the jabra's fit in-ear and had an element of noise cancellation.  the airpods sit in your ear but have no noise cancellation.  aside from that, the my old jabra's had far superior sound.  there's not much else to say, they're just better than the airpods here.3. price.  i paid $150 for the 2nd gen airpods at best buy.  i think they're down to $128 now on amazon.  the newer model of jabra elite (the 75t) is currently $129 on jabra's website.  airpods are severely overpriced for what you get and i have the feeling if you looped in other competitors (bose, sony, sennheiser, klipsch) you would find similar results.overall the one pro i'll give the airpods is connectivity.  i own an iphone, ipod, and imac and the airpods connect very quickly to apple products.  i have been an apple user since the early 2000s so they've gotten their money out of me from brand loyalty but their quality has really dropped in recent years.  i think the only reason they continue to get glowing reviews is based on this loyalty to them.  i would strongly encourage anyone looking at these airpods to check out some of the competitors first.  you will find vastly superior earbuds for the same or lower price.  but on the other hand you won't be one of the cool kids with white buds hanging off your earlobes.",7962,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i bought the airpods new.  they work great for listing to music and phone calls.  however, about 9 months in the mic on both airpods have a defect where the caller can barly hear you, or voice recordings using the airpods is very low.  being out of warranty at 9 months the only option is customer paid replacement.  after checking the support pages, there are quite a few people reporting the same issue with airpods.  buying applecare for the airpods at $30 sounds good, but it cost $30 per incident for repair/replacements.  in this case it would cost $60 to get two replacement airpods.  $60 for the airpods and $30 for the applecare puts it at another $90 for a new pair, when a new pair costs $130.  even though the warrenty is for 3 years, it only covers 2 incidents....and replacing both for the mic issue is 2 incidence.  so the 3 year warranty endes at 9 months to get the mic fix...which allows for maybe 2 years of service.apple needs a recall program for this issue, because $130-$170 for airpods what will fail at 9 months is a problem.",8036,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i hate these thing. i’ve had two pair and both have ended up having pairing issues and charging issues. after about a month’s use, for each set over two different phones and several ios updates, the headphones would consistently fail to pair, pair only one ear bud or when you wake up, you find that somehow during the night, one earbud completely lost power. makes you want to just throw them away. these things are perfect when they work. when they work. at least half the time, they’re irksome and tedious. did i mention that i hate these pieces of ****?",8179,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
these hurt my ears so bad that i had to send them back.  i even tried the little rubber slip on things to keep them from falling out but nothing worked.  i’m not able to wear the ones that come with the iphones either so if those work for you then these will too.  i upgraded to the airpods pro and they’re fabulous.,8180,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"airpods are definitely very convenient to use, especially if you like to listen to music or videos while you’re working/moving around. sound quality is standard and pretty much the same as the wired earbuds. the battery life is really good and you could listen for the entire day relatively uninterrupted if you use one airpod and swap when the battery runs low. even when i don’t use them for several days, the battery doesn’t drain so they can last a long while if you leave them around. however, there’s a frustrating issue that i’ve encountered more times than should be acceptable for rather highly priced earbuds. this is mostly relevant if you tend to only use one earbud at a time though; it’s not a major issue if you normally use both at the same time.the first pair i ordered came brand new and sealed, but within a few hours, they had already stopped working properly. the right airpod would not connect unless the left was also in use. troubleshooting guides suggested resetting the airpods, reconnecting, testing on other devices, and etc., but nothing fixed the issue, and it was consistent throughout multiple devices (iphone, ipad, pc). i ended up returning these and requesting a replacement.the second pair i received, which is the one i currently own, worked fine for the first couple weeks. however, the issue from the previous pair started occurring with these as well. i decided to keep these despite the problem because unlike the first set, these seemed to function properly at least sometimes, so they weren’t consistently dysfunctional. resetting the airpods also temporarily resolves the issue, but this isn’t the most convenient thing to do when it 1. happens rather frequently (pretty much daily) and 2. i have a case, and you need to hold onto the button on the back of the charging case to reset/reconnect. also, weirdly enough, this pair had the connection issues with both airpods. sometimes the right wouldn’t work without the left, and other times the left wouldn’t work without the right. it’s probably a weird coincidence, but it always seems like the one i want to use at any given moment is the earbud that doesn’t want to connect without the other.anyway, i kept the second pair because they were functioning well enough, and i had purchased them for $99 which i guess isn’t too awful for brand new and legitimate apple airpods. but if the price was higher and i knew about this connectivity issue, which seems to be rather common judging from all the troubleshooting forums i found, i probably wouldn’t make the purchase.",8296,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i really debated between these and the pro version but ultimately, i didn't feel i needed the adjustable fit or the full noise cancellation. i'm so happy with this purchase! the battery life is great (longer lasting than the pro version actually), charging is a breeze, small and compact so they go with me everywhere. i love them. i'm sure the wireless ones and the pro ones are really good, but these still hold their own in my opinion and are a great price for anyone who doesn't need the features of the pro version. i think wireless charging is kind of a gimmick anyway so i don't care about that in the least. i wish i'd bought them sooner.update: i’ve now been using these for 16-months and i took off one star because they don’t connect and switch seamlessly between my ipad and iphone, which is the main reason i purchased these over a different brand. also, they often don’t auto-connect to even one of them to start with. they are supposed to connect as soon as you put them in your ears to whichever of your devices is activated or whichever one you used last (you can adjust that in settings) but they don’t. i often have to go into the settings and manually connect them. they also often only connect in one ear - hugely annoying! i’ve had them randomly disconnect when on a phone call or watching something as well. they worked great for about six months but now i constantly have issues with them so i’m looking at purchasing another pair of wireless earbuds from a recognizable brand that is known for their sound quality. sorry, apple.",8336,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

these are the worst.  battery life is 3 hours tops. plus they don't pair.,8338,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i’m sure it’s been said many times, but from a functional design standpoint, these are a complete flop. why in the world would apple design earbuds that are slippery, don’t fit in the ear well, won’t accept any silicone adapters (and still be able to fit it in the case), and have pieces sticking out waiting to get caught on everything. you will lose these in a hot minute and never even know it fell out of your ear. because of this i would never buy these (they were a gift).that being said, the sound and mic quality is very good compared to the cheaper options.",8339,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i have owned these airpods for less than 2 months and they are already not working. i’ve only used them a handful of times when studying for major exams and cleaning around my house. i have tried everything and even researched how to fix my issue. they are glitching and only connecting for 5-6 seconds before crackling and not working at all. i even have a screen recording off my iphone of the airpods glitching when connected. i contacted amazon “support” and he told me he could not help me even though i’m only 10 days past the return window and would not give me an exchange. what a waste. i would not order these through amazon! buy directly from apple.,8355,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"want to do any sort of activity with these in? even a light walk perhaps? forget it!!! these things fall out of my ears like it’s their job. i bought hooks and rubber attachments but you have to take those on and off whenever you want to put them in the case. it’s just apple’s ploy to get you to buy the pros, which are much better designed... or you could get another brand for 20% the cost with the same quality.",8474,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i bought it as a holiday gift to myself. but the sound quality was disappointing. more disappointing is that the bluetooth turn off automatically without any reason. i bought it less than two months and use it only when i was study online. besides, it's bluetooth coverage is small, i don't use it a lot during this two month because i sometimes need to walk around the house and my old samsung's coverage is better. i wanted to give this fully charged airpods another try this morning, but the problems remained and the troubleshooting wouldn't help..... all i can say, save your money to buy something better. don't buy it because it's from apple.",8480,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
this was my second pair! (i melted the first pair in the dryer! always check your pockets!) after 3 months of daily use the left one quit working! there was no reason for this too happen. that’s when i learned that these air pods are covers by apple for 1 year. i took them to an authorized apple dealer and had the ledger one replaced for free! i normally don’t write reviews but i just wanted to mention the warranty because it’s something i did not know about! other than the above mentioned.. i love these headphines!,8481,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i had these airpods for about 1.5 years and they just stopped working.  apple said they would send me replacement airpods (not charging case) but would cost me $156 (more than i would pay for a whole new set of airpods on amazon).  the battery life was always less than they advertise and they never fit my ear very well (would fall out when i ran).  so i would not recommend these to anyone.  i just bought jabra earbuds so hopefully that will be a better experience.,8484,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i’ve had these for a week and here’s my review. i love them. the sound is nice and they have such cool features. and if you want them, get them. but not from amazon. the first package i received was open and missing the airpods. then the second one came busted and already opened like the pictures show. i don’t understand what happened but, i’m you should get get them somewhere else.",8485,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i found you on amazon prime day, waiting in the warehouse deals; you said you were ""very good"" and looking for a new beginning, but i now realize it was all lies because inside, you were a mess. i tried to listen to you with enthusiasm and joy but know now you were just a toy. after a few minutes or so, i sensed the ""disconnect"" between us as you would just shut down for no apparent reason, but i now know you came into my life with issues that were never disclosed. however, it was likely never to be, as we were not a suitable ""fit"" from the moment we encountered.  for one, i never felt ""comfortable"" with you, or did i appreciate you just ""falling out"" on me when i needed you to stay.  looking back, it appears all we did was waste each other's time, but i have to say life is genuinely better now since i got you packed and dropped off at kohl's.  i can only hope that you will make someone else happy and proud one day, but unfortunately, i only see pain, frustration, disappointment, and anger for anyone who gets involved with you. therefore, let's not forget honesty remains the best policy, and deception can never be the answer to unloading one's problems.",8500,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i purchased this product at the end of 2019.  it is now january of 2021 and the sound is almost completely out. i don’t use them very often so maybe the lack of usage has caused the sound to go out . when i first got them i loved them but now i have no use for them because i can’t hear. i just can’t believe this happened because i know people who have had the same airpods since they came out. i’m curious to know if it has anything to do with the seller,8504,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i had first generation airpods and they lasted almost two years.  i was planning to buy new pair but i wasn’t in the rush because they still worked, sound was decent and battery would last me 2-3 hours before i had to put them on the charger.  somehow i misplaced them so instead of looking for them, i decided to buy a pair on amazon.  they were cheaper than apple store so i thought i was getting good deal, not!  first of all, sound is really bad, there is static in the background and i’m hearing an echo of some unknown music (not what i’m listening).  last drop was battery life.  first time it happened i thought that my daughter might have used my airpods and drained my battery.  this time i fully charged them, charging station and airpods were 100% charged.  i placed them in my purse where they will be safe, and not borrowed by teenager.  they were sitting in my purse for 4-5 days, not being used at all so they should be fully charged.  well the light was green for a few seconds, then it changed to orange.  pods were not connecting to my phone even though i tried to connect them by holding button in the back of charging station.  i even tried to forget device on my phone, then reconnect, but at that point orange light on the charging station disappeared, and that happens only if they are completely drained, dead.  today they will be going back to amazon.  i don’t want another pair, i want full refund, and i’ll be buying a new pair from good old apple store.",8516,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i bought these to be able to run and listen to music without carrying a phone.  apple claims that their handoff feature allows airpods connected to the iphone to hand off a connection to an apple watch when you go beyond bluetooth range from the phone.  this never works.  you either have to take the phone along, or turn off the phone, then pair with the watch, and then leave.another problem is that after maybe 45-60 minutes, the music sometimes stalls and needs to be restarted, but invariably only one channel comes back (and sometimes neither one).  very annoying.  this tends to happen more in cooler weather, even with a hat on that covers the ears.beyond those two issues (which are enough to make me not recommend the air pods, at least if you plan to use them like i do), everything is ok.  sound is ok for non-noise-cancelling earphones; not great frequency response, but for this type of earphone you can't expect a lot.  they fit nicely and do not tend to fall out of the ear.  battery life is also pretty good, at least for my purposes; i can run for a couple of hours and change and they are still working (unless they don't, as described above, but that isn't the battery).  the apple watch runs out of juice before the earphones.",8543,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"this is design to work with iphone macbook etc. after all apple desgin their product to work best with their product. it can work with android phone just like a regular bluetooth device but you will lose those features that are unique to apple. and you will be better off buying those generic bluetooth that is much cheaper. indeed, i do not feel any sound difference between airpods 2 and those i bought off street. but, if music quality is something you want + noise cancellation feature, go for airpod pro which now i feel it is more worthy. however, 2 main problem with me is that 1.  even though i have iphones and macbook, i don't wear headphones so it's a waste to spend on such expensive gadget 2. my friends who reccoomend this to me about how ""they sleep without feelign its in ears"" but it doesn't work.... i feel strange wearing them, i can definitely feel i am wearing headphone, and the left ear one keeps falling out of my ear on its own!! i was sitting and watching movies, not even moving at all and it slip out every 60s. so ... i will say ear type matters too... if air pods isn't for you and you really want apple, go for the pro.",8565,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i really want to like them. they're supposed to be effortlessly convenient to pair and use for all your apple devices while sounding and looking good. but they're not....they're none of that. let me explain:sound - it's ok, really. no seal so you hear all the ambient noise around you which is good and bad depending on the situation. not much for bass extension, treble is flat but clear. adequate all things considered. if you've used the old design earpods, these are nearly the same sound profile. on a plus, the microphones are very good.features - very little to say here. they're bluetooth (5.0) so they pair quickly and have long range, when they work (more on that later).battery life - very good, a couple hours at high-ish volume on the pods and half a dozen charges per case charge. more than i need for most situations.functionality - 100% atrocious and i've had 3 sets of these (shame on me). the case and charging system is so faulty it leads to numerous other problems with pairing and connecting both airpods at the same time. the contact points in the case and on the pods where they charge easily loses connection, dirties, and later corrodes. using them for fitness around any sweat or moisture will speed up their inevitable failure. once this happens, one pod will refuse to charge or stay connected when put back in the case, draining it's battery or trying to reconnect to different devices when in the case. even if they didn't suffer constant bugs, the pairing with multiple devices is equally buggy, frequently losing connection or trying to connect to other devices in the house for no apparent reason.as far as i can tell, airpods pro share the same charging design, so i will listen to my own advice and stay far away from these until the design is fixed. i would advise you do the same.",8592,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"at first these headphones were great. then the new wore off. i found that they were getting quieter and didn’t block out any ambient noise which for me was a huge turn off because i use music as an escape from the screaming of my family and shop environment. secondly about 5 months in the left side speaker blew. now for most people they wouldn’t be bothered but for me i’m kinda mad because i spent 150 dollars of my good money for this garbage that doesn’t sound good, and broke way before it’s duty was over. the fitment was also a big turn off, they would constantly fall out of my ears and were uncomfortable to wear. then the bane of their existence, the case would load up with so much metal filings that it wouldn’t be able to shut and charge the dang things. i’d have to clean it out with alcohol once a week just so they would charge. the only thing i liked about these was, how they looked, how they read texts to you, how they paired with your phone seamlessly and the sound they made when they hit the bottom of the garbage can. avoid at all costs!!! they’re a cheap headphone with premium features that’s why they’re so expensive.",8697,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"it's becoming more well known that these types of headphones are considered ""disposable"" technology.  unfortunately none of us early adopters were made aware of this.  so just a heads up, expect standard airpods to last no more than 3 years before they're garbage.  i purchased mine in dec 2017 and they began showing battery issues in summer 2020 and by december 2020 they wouldn't stay on.  the left would cut out in 2-3mins (after being pulled from the case showing the earbud was at 100%) and the right would sometimes stay on for 10 or 15mins max.  again neither earbud showed as extremely low percentage even though they would both die way too soon.so if standard airpods are $159 from apple and they only last 2.5-3 years then to keep yourself using airpods it's going to cost around $50 a year for as long as you want them (to work).  this is good for apple, but not for the consumer.from what research shows, battery degradation is related to battery size.  therefore expect even worse performance and lifespan out of airpod pro's.",8699,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

sound quality could be clearer. after not using them for two weeks they lost their charge. they fell out while jogging once. overall pretty good.,8842,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
it didn’t even come with any airpods in it!!!! not to mention it didn’t have a seal in it so i knew something was wrong and when i opened it no airpods just the charger!,8843,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
overall these are decent headphones. the sound quality is average and they don't have any noise cancelation like the newer pro version. they constantly fall out of my ears and i can never get them comfortable. i have pairs of small ear phones that work the same and have better sound quality at half the price. this is just another overpriced product because there is an apple slapped on the side. the sound quality is similar to regular apple ear phones which isn’t that great. if you don't have to have everything apple then look elsewhere.,8844,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"having used samsung galaxy buds for 2+ years, when i switched to this, i had a very mixed reaction. it is comfortable, lightweight and better design than galaxy buds but i think the sound quality is better in galaxy buds. galaxy buds ambient noise feature was not 100% noise cancellation but still had a better ""noise cancellation"" than airpods. and airpods have such poor battery life but on the flip side takes less time to charge. airpods look good on the ear but i feel like it might drop anytime while walking or hiking. i  had no such fear while wearing galaxy buds.overall, not that good as expected and not that bad.",8845,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"this alternative version to the pricier pods by apple is a weak substitute. first, they frequently fell out my ears. in public, that`s a high risk of losing them or getting damaged. secondly, battery life is good at about two hours of play. after that, the sound quality begins to weaken. i suggest buying the more expensive pods for better quality and more permanent placement in your ears.",8853,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"pros: i never experienced an issue with the sound not synchronizing between the left and right pods. they paired nicely with the iphone for what that's worth.cons: the sound quality was always poor to mediocre. they would were constantly falling out of my ear when exercising. one of the earbuds was consistently unable to charge, resulting in me having one charged earbud and one uncharged. recently, they have both started unpairing, making them unusable. the batteries also lasts about an hour at most, which is a fraction of how long they used to last when new. i could go on.on top of all of these technical issues, the apple replacement policy is not what it's cracked up to be. when i tried to replace them they would only agree to replace the airpod case instead of the actual earbuds, which i assume is where the faulty equipment exists, since replacing the case did not resolve the charging issue i mentioned above.i won't be buying these or the airpod pros because of this experience and i wouldn't recommend them. i have absolutely no clue how these have such a high rating.",8856,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i feel like my pods are defective. the battery doesn’t last long, the sound goes in and out, and they fall out easily.the reason why i haven’t returned it, is because i lost the box, thinking anything from apple would guarantee to work right.i wouldn’t buy again. i have some cheap bluetooth headphones that works better.",8857,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

these definitely belonged to someone before landing in my hands. when i paired them it said “rita’s airpods.” there was only two pieces of tape on the outside box and it was dirty. the quality was terrible and the left headphone stopped working. it’s things like this that really discourage me from ordering online. 😞,8983,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

very disappointed! my airpods literally stop working whenever they feel like it. my bluetooth connectivity has a glitch. i can be on a call and get the “hello are you there ???” they will not reconnect and when they do it’s intermittent at best. this is the second time this has happened. wont ever be waisting money on airpods ever again.,8997,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

right air pod  doesn’t work,9013,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
sound quality is about the same as the wired ear pods. they fit my ears perfectly. i could wear them all day with no problem. i've actually forgotten that i was wearing them a few times. i like the convenience of not having to re-pair them across ios devices. what i dont like is the latency. the sound is almost a second behind youtube videos played on my macbook. the battery life is terrible. i get about 5 hours even if i dont have audio playing through them the entire time. i bought these to complement my anker soundcore liberty pro 2's which sound way better than the airpods but hurt my ears due to the tips being jammed into my ear canal.,9014,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"works well for music but not for phone calls. i’ve had them for a few months, i missed the return date due to traveling. i thought maybe it was my phone because it was older but i got an 11 and people still can’t hear me. i can only use them for listening to music which doesn’t make them worth the price",9015,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
purchased these on prime day but three weeks later they were $15 cheaper. i contacted customer service to see if i could get a refund for the difference since i am a prime member and have been for several years - but was shot down. ☹️ disappointed that prime day was not the best deal. think my daughter will still enjoy them though.,9016,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i was excited to get these earbuds since i have seen many people using them and they have good reviews. however, their performance is subpar. the sound is very thin and tires me out after a while. even bigger problem is that the bluetooth connection keeps getting disrupted at road intersections.  for me, living in nyc and walking a lot, this unstable bluetooth connection makes these earbuds unusable. however, if you live in rural areas you should have no problem with this.",9040,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

great at first but over the course of a few months they’ve seemed to lose the ability to connect consistently. the battery life has also seemed to die somewhat faster but the main issue i’ve came across is that they connect as they’re supposed to when you put them in but they disconnect right after and fail to connect manually through the settings. for the price i absolutely believe this shouldn’t be a persistent problem like it is.,9079,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"so this is my second pair of airpods and i'm actually pretty disappointed in the overall quality. i don't see anything about them being refurbished but they certainly do not perform like my old airpods i got directly from apple. at first i thought i didn't think much of it because i've only had them for one month but these airpods static and click off regularly but the phone is still registering them as on and the videos/podcasts/music keeps playing but i can't hear anything. i have to take them off and put them in the case and take them back out for them to reconnect and i can hear just fine. worse when it happens on phone calls and fts because they're still connected with no sound. they do this several times a day. not only that, sometimes when i take them out of the case and they are supposed to ""automatically connect,"" sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. sometimes only one does and the only thing that fixes it is me taking both of them in and out of the case several times. sometimes they're connected straight of of the case with no sound. unfortunately my return window closed about 11 days ago which infuriates me because i would like a replacement. again, i have just barely had these for a month. as a realtor and a mom, i need to have free hands. so disappointing and frustrating.",9090,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i own a pixel 2xl for personal but have an iphone 8 for business as does my wife. i ordered the air pods 1) because they were on sales and, 2) for business calls expecting high end quality as apple is known for. first, the quality build of the product is excellent. they connect easily to bluetooth and i must say i found the sound quality better than expected. however, the lack of a rubberized ""ear piece"" causes them to sit on the ear rather than in it. this diminishes noise cancellation. it also feels like they will fall out if i move around too much but admittedly, that is a personal preference and based on my ear ""anatomy"". what surprised me most (and disappointed) was the short battery life compared to other non-apple ear pods i have owned. the specs say 5-hours (which is short to begin with) but tests reviews i have read say 4.2 hours at best. not for me. i'm barely getting 3-hours. so for someone who is constantly on conference calls, i'm forced to switch back to the wired ear pods. and when one considers what apple charges $159.00 plus (when not on sale) for this and all its products, the value just isn't there. unless you are an apple fanatic, there are better wireless ear pods on the market that offer a better value.",9095,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i love these air pods.  price finally came down from the original price when they first came out so i went for them.  the last pair of head phones i owned was back when the wired version was around so it’s been a few years.  these sounds great.. love having no wires.  they stay in my ears no problem.  i didn’t want noise cancelling headphones so these are perfect.  i like them especially at the gym hearing what’s going on around me.  i feel almost unsafe with noise canceling headphones.. battery life is great.  i highly recommend buying theseupdate:the right airpod has been slowly going bad over the last couple weeks and now it’s always at 1% life when i open the up to pair them.  that’s with 100% charged case.  they’ll start charging when i open the case... great while they lasted.  used indoors only to.. disappointed especially for the price i expect better from apple,9135,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

at the beginning the airpods were great. but after 3 weeks the sound got lower and lower. if i have my phone on medium volumen i can’t hear anything. i have to have them on high volume to be able to hear the music. at the beginning it wasn’t like that. and i have tried other headphones and the other headphones work just fine with my phone. so i’m sure it’s the airpods. i will try to go to the apple store to see if they can fix them.,9204,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i love how comfortable these are. the sound quality is good and the bluetooth range is impressive. the battery life is fine. nothing incredible, but it will get you through 3-4 days before you have to charge the case again.  however, they do not last! i bought a pair of the original airpods and they lasted about a year before the microphone went out on the left ear. 3 months later the microphone on the right airpod went out.because i have small ears i have a hard time finding earbuds that work so i caved and bought a gen 2 about 6 months ago.guess what happened?! yep. the left microphone went out. i fully anticipate the right one will go anytime now.so even though these are comfortable and have great sound quality i do not recommend. if i’m spending more than $100 for earbuds they should work for more than 6-12 months.i’m on the hunt again and i’ll find something that lasts more than a minute. or something cheap enough that it won’t hurt my feelings to have to replace every 6 months.",9205,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

(c'mon bose, klipsh, cambridge, somebody, anybody...) i have tried another brand with lots of good reviews and promises of hifi sound, (and i am not even a hifi weenie, lol) but the sound was noticeably, unarguably, far worse that ap's.so, here i am doing it again. please apple, for the environment, at least : build stuff that lasts, like i expect from you. everything else i have from apple at least lasts...",9233,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

sound quality is fine just like normal apple earbuds it could be louder. these have no noise cancellation just like regular apple earbuds. the battery life would get 5 stars if it lived up to the specification but for for some reason one of my airpods loses battery life faster. when the battery begins to drop under 30% one of them always drops about 10% lower than the other even though i’m using both of them at the same time. i don’t know if this is normal of if i received a defective unit. i bought apple care for these but all the apple stores are currently closed. i don’t think that is normal and i’d expect more from a $130+ product.,9275,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"worst apple product i have every owned. it works when it connects properly - 50:50 chance most days. i messed for days with it,looking ip troubleshoots and getting frustrated when one of the buds would disconnect simply because of static or a tiny earring clicking against it. worst money i’ve ever spent. should have sent it back when the return window was still open. now i’ll just use it on day when i have patience to get it to work. will never purchase a new pair of these and would not recommend. i literally am typing this, while i have my old cord headphones attached to the phone, at least they work foolproof. save your money, do not get these",9331,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"really like them when they work, only had them two months but the three times now the left one did not connect, have had to plug them in to charge and that seems to reset it, one time both went off even though they said connected so i choose “forget this device” then connected again. that’s a lot to go wrong in two months, especially because they haven’t been used every day or even for more than 8 hrs at any given day. disappointing but i guess i only paid $135 so not premium price. didn’t want the newest ones as that style doesn’t fit my ears comfortably.",9333,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"the longer i have them (and i haven't had them long, too long to return) the worse they get!!!! i can make about 10 calls and then they sound horrible....they sound like there is such a bad connection and garbled....very disappointed in these and wish i had returned them when i had the chance.  sometimes we get a lemon",9335,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i've been wanting to get wireless earphones for quite some time. finally ordered these and once i put them in my ears, the right one made the 'on' sound and the left one never did. both had more than 90% battery life. i played music and the right worked with good sound quality. i tried looking up ways to troubleshoot but sadly nothing worked. i saw a lot of complaints saying one pod stopped working. there is no way i'm paying a high amount for it to be dead like this. returned it the same day.",9336,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

when you buy an apple product you pay a premium price and with that comes the expectation that the product will work. what one does not expect is that upon unboxing the airpods you find that they won’t connect and after 30 minutes of searching you find that one airpods firmware is outdated and there is no way to manually update it. it is a poor design on the part of apple and i would not recommend this product to anyone. apple is slipping and it shows in their products.,9340,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i use these for high intensity, sweaty exercise almost every day. i’ve bought these twice. they are great for a few months and then quickly deteriorate to the point where one or both will not charge. you think they are charging based on the indicator light but you’ll be disappointed to find one didn’t connect and charge up. then, there’s a feature where when you flip open the lid case, a dialogue box pops open on your iphone and displays the charging levels of each airpod and the case. that feature will begin to stop working over time as well for no apparent reason. i would not spend so much money on these and go with a half price competitor if i can’t expect these to last more than 4-5 months.",9345,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

it's really weird to give an apple product a 3 star review. apple rocks in all it does. the problem is that i tried to have these pods work with my samsung phone. it was a very disappointing experience - poor connection and the battery lasts only half a day.... i'm sure that iphone users have a much better experience with this product! i'm simply conveying my honest experience as an android user. i've returned them... :(,9357,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

i’ve had these for a little over a month now and one of the airpods already stopped working. and of course the window for returns was only 30 days so basically i spent all that money for a product that i maybe used 20 times. save your money and just go to target or at&t. or better yet spend a little more at the apple store. at least there you get a 90 day warranty.,9387,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"the most horrible experience, i bought these for my girlfriend and she was excited to try them and then i tried to pair them to her phone and they wont connect at all or even show up the animation screen of the airpods on her i phone, i looked up online and it said that the previous user has to forget the device from their phone in order to pair to a new phone, and we can not or amazon contact the pervious user to get that done, so when asked for my options, i could of eaither get a replacement which i'm hoping won't be the same thing or a refund but i have to send back the headphones but i don't have much time due to work at the moment, so that is what i'm stuck with unfortunately so i just asked for a replacement at the moment, so disappointed in this product",9392,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"didn’t even last 2 years. battery case went out in less than a year after purchase. apple store replaced the case since it was within the 1 year warranty, about 5 months later the left pod died.  shortly after the right one. don’t waste your money, unless you get the apple care for 2 years, you’d have to shell out $90 to have either pod replaced, glad i didn’t since the right one died so soon after the left one did. pieces of junk!!",9393,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

it’s ok in the beginning. although even from the start there is no noise cancellation not even passive noise canceling (ear buds) and they slip out if you have them on for a few hours. the sound quality to me is ok i guess? it does sound good but not exactly great. but the main problem with these truly witless earbuds is that they lose sound after only about three months of having them. i try my hardest to keep my ears clean while having them in and i also kinda quickly clean them afterwards with like my shirt but they are so silent now i can’t even take them to the gym. although they’re mostly meant for casual use they are supposed to withstand light drops of water and easily bare earwax. so honestly try spending a bit more for something more worth while and will last longer,9427,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"if i hadn't authenticated the serial number, i'd seriously think i was sold a counterfeit product.  since this is an authentic, new product, i'm just left to believe the product is mediocre at best.i regularly use my air pods on both ios and android devices. the air pods connect relatively quickly and easily to both, but especially with other apple devices. (for some reason, the max volume is significantly lower on my android device.) the bluetooth range is not great with reception starting to break up if you move more than 4-5' away from the phone.  the sound is pretty clear, but less than 10 weeks after purchase, individual ear buds will cut in and out or get static-y even while sitting stationary next to my phone.  like other reviewers, my individual ear buds don't seem to charge evenly with one often dying well before the second.  i've also been disappointed with the battery performance. the ear buds re-charge quickly when inserted into the case and i'd say i can probably get 5 hours of run time between charges of the *case*, but i struggle to regularly get more than 2 hours of run time per full charge of the ear buds (and oftentimes not even that).  finally, i have no idea how people wear these all the time as i found the shape of the air pods to be tremendously uncomfortable.

"i never liked the idea of apple getting rid of the headphone jack but never knew why.now i know. it wasn't to make space for more tech in the phone. it was to boost the sales of bluetooth headphones. and it worked. apple made a lot of money.i got mine and i really liked them. i also have 100 dollar wired earphones. i've had them both for about 3 years. the airpods no longer have a 4 hour battery. it has a 1 one hour battery per charge. i called apple to ask about getting a replacement. they said it was 70 bucks per airpod. i said, i might as well buy a new pair.that's when it hit me. apple is making money with the increase in sales for bluetooth headphones but also insuring that people will come back to buy more when the battery no longer holds a charge. they know this. i don't know about you, but if i pay over 100 dollars for some headphones. i want it to last more than 3 years. my wired earphones work like the day i bought them.this is diabolically evil of apple.i am telling you this as a warning. if you buy bluetooth headohones, be prepared to buy a new set in 2-3 years because the battery will inevitably die.",9480,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"mixed feelings on this item.  i have a pair that i have had for about a year and a half that still work well.  i only use them a few times a week, but other than the fact that they constantly fall out of my ears, i like them.  if i wasn't able to find the aftermarket silicone ear hooks that i need to use to keep them from falling out all the time, i would have returned them and give them a 1 star rating.  to be fair, i have small ears.  so, i would consider another option if you have small ears.  that said, this review is for a second pair i bought as a gift.  unfortunately, after 6 months the right pod would not charge/work at all.  the left one would work, but only for about 20 min.  if fully charged and left in the charging case, both the case and the working pod would completely drain, which implies the batteries are not good in the case or the pod(s).  the person i bought these for didn't tell me about the problems until several months after she noticed it.  so, i had her give them to me and contacted apple.  support was really good and they tried to help me get them to work over the phone.  unfortunately, no luck.  so, i asked what my options were to get them replaced or fixed.  they said they were out of warrantee and it would cost over $200 +$12 s&h to get them repaired.  i paid under $150 for them, so naturally all i could say was thanks for the help...  i guess i'll just throw these in the trash.  there are a lot of options out there that are a lot less pricy.  so, i will replace the gift, since i don't like to give a gift that is defective.  however, i may look at the samsung or a couple of others that are out there.  again, the ones i own still work fine.  this pair was obviously just a ""lemon"", but since apple wasn't willing to do anything, i have a bad taste in my mouth.  pretty disappointed with apple.  such good service, but won't stand behind their products.  don't even get me started about the easy-break glass on their phones and pads.",9510,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"after less than 2 months, the right pod stopped charging. it will sit in a fully charged case for a day and come out with only 4% life remaining. return window closed after a month so i spent  $130 for a product that doesn’t even last two months. buyer beware.",9513,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

they worked great for the first few months but then started having to charge a little more often and now i get people saying they can't hear me. i bought these for work as i speak with a lot of provider offices but since they seem to be going in and out i can no longer use - definitely a waste - i will stick to buying from apple directly as they stand behind there products regardless of time,9517,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i was hesitant to purchase airpods because of the steep price so when i saw there was a deal a few months ago (early 2020) i hopped on the bandwagon! since i have many apple products, these do make it easier to sync up to my macbook, iphone and ipad. however, even with that being the case the airpods i received were defective. i spent hours talking to customer service and at the apple store (pre-covid) and they ended up having to replace the case and one of the airpods. at times i still have issues with connectivity and the microphone isn't the greatest. sometimes my airpods would be in the case and i wasn't trying to connect to my phone yet the music would play while they were in the case. i even reported this to the apple care team and my customer service representative told me it was something they'd never seen or heard about before. (seriously wish i was making this up, i just wanted to be able to have wireless earbuds).i'll admit that i don't fully regret my purchase, but regret buying it via amazon instead of from the apple store or a major retailer (i.e. best buy). not sure if my logic makes sense, but i feel like there would've have been less of a chance of getting a faulty item.tlr; airpods aren't a bad investment, but be wary and monitor your item if you buy it via amazon. also they aren't noise cancelling and the microphone isn't the greatest. the sound is ok but if you want to still spend a good amount of money, you probably can get better quality headphones elsewhere. the best feature to me is that it is super connected with my apple products and i can tap to change the songs, etc.",9521,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"this product is shoddy. there is so much break in sounds it is ridiculous. i am better offusing the regular wired headset. i tried everything including charging the apple  airpods overnight thinking that may be the problem. of course to no avail. i got tired of  the pods that i left them  on the shelf. of course when i called amazon, they called apple and referred me to apple customer service instead. sorry i bought this poor quality product. i may have been better off with chinese “ knock off” version, if such is on the market",9522,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"on july 31, 2020 i was buying these 2 generation airpods at a price of $ 129 dollars + shipping for a total of $ 138.03 dollars. i sacrificed saving money to buy this product, but after i received it and tried it, i began to realize that the sound is not of high quality and it sounds very bad. previously i had 2 airpods and i know how they listen. it is a unique and excellent sound but the ones that came to me are useless. after claiming the amazon customer service they tell me to return them to be able to make a refund, i explain that it is very difficult for me to return them because i live in the dominican republic the shipping cost is very high, even so the customer service agent tells me that i should return it. i feel bad because i did not imagine that amazon handled this way with its customers. now without money and without airpods, because it is not worth using them like that with that bad sound.",9551,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

the airpods i received are great but there was one problem with my order. i bought new air pods but received used air pods. when i went to connect them they had some “alexandria's roommates airpods” as the name... as far as i know that sounds like  these must have been a pair of used earpods.. i feel like i need the price difference back..,9554,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

overhyped product. i should have better bought in store after trying them. it is so irritating that they don't stay in ear and fall down. sound quality is okay. nothing great. i am hardly using them right now. i feel it was waste of money.  i would suggest to check out brands before finalizing this one.,9562,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"these ear pods are wonderful in quality of sound, ease of use.  i particularly like how you just lift it into your ear and it knows to switch.  i have not figured out how to answer and end a call without having to tap the phone, but haven’t looked it up.  tapping the airpod activates the music and switches the song, which is nice, but i have to find out if i can stop music play.downside:  battery life is surprisingly and disappointingly brief.  i used them for a phone call that lasted about 1 1/2 hours.  the buds went dead before the call was finished!ears are not one size fits all.  i must be careful when using them or they will fall out of my ear.  having to pay an additional $100 for the “pro"" model, which is supposed to have adjustable fittings, is a rip off.  it’s like buying a pair of shoes, advertised at $100.  “oh, you want them in your size?  well, that will be an additional $100.""  so, if purchasing these, beware of the fit.i will not recommend these or purchase again.",9674,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i purchased these airpods when i got tired of being told i sounded ""garbled"", ""far away in a room"" and ""very quiet"".  i can narrow the problem down to the left airpod.  if i remove it then i can be heard fine.  i did not pay for one airpod however.  i'm confident apple will blame the dysfunction on something else as is their modus operandi, even though i have an iphone.",9676,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i’ve had a few issues with these. they have randomly shocked my ear. i’ve had issue with them syncing to my phone, or one earphone won’t come on. when i open my case, they wont show in my phone screen anymore.  i am not sure if these have been refurbished or i just got a not so great pair. you might be better off finding something a little cheaper.",9817,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i bought a different type of ear buds that did not last. i decided to get the apple name brand. they are expensive but i didn’t want to spend money on off brand ear buds that broke down all the time. this apple air buds was easy to install and sync both buds together. not the greatest sound but okay for me. battery life was good also.,9818,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"these arrived with earwax in them so obviously they were not new. the picture is all of the earwax that i scraped off of the airpods with a toothpick. i also wiped them down with rubbing alcohol wipes to clean them and get everything completely off. when i tried to use them, they were already registered to somebody as well. otherwise, they are a great product.",9819,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

very expensive with not so much difference vs the 30-40 usd options.,9823,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"it is amazingly easy to pair these bluetooth earphones and to switch between devices, which is why i bought them.  however, they are equally easy to knock out of your ears if you have long hair (so you may need to buy a cord to connect them and to hang around your neck).  my biggest complaint is the cruddy standby battery life.  if you leave them in your ears without any music playing the battery will still be dead in around 2 hours.  that is no where near the 5 hours of music per charge promised by apple!  at this point i'm banking on durability to make up for the high price.  if these die in 6 months like all my other bluetooth headphones i will be furious and go back to cheaper alternatives with better battery life.",9824,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

very disappointed with sound quality! i’ve bought $20 headphones that have better noise cancelation than these. ended up returning because they kept falling out of my ears as well. save your money and don’t give in to the trend,9838,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"in order to determine whether or not these airpods were real, i immediately checked to see if the serial number matched apple's official website. the number couldn't be verified. after opening the box, i noticed two things: ""the designed by apple in california"" was black, not grey, and inside the case were small black particles. not only was it until i visited helpful websites that explain how to spot fake airpods that i knew these were fake. please don't be fooled by the packaging!of course, this does not mean that all airpods from amazon are fake. a friend of mine purchased them from here last year and hers was verifiable. so, i think it's a case-by-case situation. make sure to do some research once you receive the package!overall, i was looking so forward to finally purchasing my first airpods, but the end result was very dismaying and disappointing. although it would cost more, to play it safe, i would recommend purchasing from the official website!",9839,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i was really looking forward to getting airpods for my new job. these have good sound quality and, so far, the battery life has been good. however, these are not airpod 2 like many people answered above. i know this because i checked the hardware version after they were connected to my phone.if you are looking for airpods for a decent price, get these. if you are looking for airpod 2, keep looking.",9840,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i have had nothing but issues with these.apple tried to make these so smart, but they never work as intended. use them for meetings but when you touch or adjust them in your ears, they disconnect you from the call. i have double tap actions turned off.i go on runs with them and enjoy the sound and the comfort. other than that, the software and function of them are awful. don't join an important meeting with these unless you plan on sitting absolutely still and not touching them.i can't believe how bad these were engineered.",9842,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"my first pair of airpods were the generation 1s.  they were great for a couple months and then they would not connect to my iphone.  this has happened now with my third pair.  i usually only wear one airpod (left ear) while at work and that is the first to go, every time.  i'm hoping apple will improve the durability of this product in the future.  it does not look promising as gen 1 and gen 2 were both very bad quality in terms of longevity of the product.",9844,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
these headphones appeared fine at first.but after just 6 weeks of using them the left earpod began to glitch. at first i let it slide thinking it could be a one-time thing.it simply runs out of battery much earlier than the right one even though both claim to have the same amount of battery life.sometimes it will even die at “60% or 70%” battery.disappointed,9845,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

overall i have really enjoyed my airpods but have only had them for a couple months. sound quality is pretty decent. noise cancellation isn’t noticeable but then again these are not designed for noise cancellation so i wasn’t really expecting that aspect. i gave noise cancellation 2 stars in case someone might be looking for that. battery life is as expected and there isn’t a complaint there. here’s my main complaint and i consider it a big one. for the first couple weeks i have really enjoyed the airpods and used them for hands free calling. within the last week people have started complaining they cannot hear me very well while speaking on the phone. i have tried adjusting the position of the buds in case the mic wasn’t close to my mouth and i have tried cleaning them but things haven’t improved. here’s the kick in the teeth...yesterday was the last day for me to return them through amazon. i’m currently waiting to speak with apple.,9924,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i'm fully in the apple ecosystem: iphone, ipad, mac. it was time to replace my wireless headphones and heard so much about the airpods and so many friends love them, decided to stay apple.  indeed airpods work great with apple products. if that's all you're going to use them for, don't hesitate. i've bought and returned 3 other airbud products. primary issue was the device staying in the ear, then sound quality.  airpods stay in your ears and the sound is very good for the price point.however........i'm primarily interested in wireless help with hearing especially my tvs.  i do not have apple tv. one tv is a smart samsung with bluetooth and the other is panasonic that i've added a bluetooth transmitter.  anything that's not apple has no issue pairing with the tvs.  when it comes to pairing the airpods, my blood pressure rises each time. sometimes they pair, sometimes not.  but that's not the real issue.  the airpods do not have independent sound control. if you're using an apple device, you control the sound through the device like phone, watch etc.  however, my tvs (two major brands) do not have volume control for output. very few tvs do.  so if the volume is too high or too low, i need to disconnect from the tv, pair with an apple device, get the volume where i think i want it, then disconnect, then re-pair with the tv and hope the volume is somewhere near where i like it.i spoke with apple about this and their response is buy an apple tv device. that way the airpod will pair and sound can be controlled. in my case, i would need to buy 2 apple tv devices.  the low priced airbuds come with volume control, apparently there isn't any technology magic required.  apple is choosing to not include.i'm still undecided about returning the airpods. the fit, comfort and sound are well worth the price. the volume annoyance is a reminder each time i use these things that apple is not the customer focused/design company we think they are.  before i bought the airpods, i spoke with 3 friends who use and highly recommend.  each one told me i would be able to control the volume with my iphone or ipad. after talking with apple, that is not the case.while on that subject, since my last apple purchase this is the first time in about 18 months that i've needed to talk with apple support.  what has happened over there?  four calls in two weeks; each time i feel like i'm speaking with someone that is just reading a script and doesn't really understand the issue.  the solution to most any issue seems to be, buy something else apple.  as a long time shareholder who's gone through a lot of stock splits, i appreciate the focus on apple products but come on, there's more solutions to improving an apple product than buying another apple product.",9926,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

great product but please don’t buy it at the current price. the sound quality is up to par with any other 30-40$ ear buds/head phones. it also falls out when you try to run with it. it’s so easy to fall out and disappear. poof 150$ gone. the charging case is really not 150$ worth of innovation. the highest i would pay for the entire thing is 60$ now that i have it.,9930,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i was promised a certain amount of battery life on these, and it wasn't delivered. one of them only lasts a little over an hour. the other only a couple hours. just got them 4 days ago and already have to exchange them for the pro version- hopefully those will be worth the hefty price tag.",9931,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"after few months used , this airpod has been not that good , the battery life seems go away very fast , and the connection to phone were weak , it keeps disconnecting.. by the way if i spend almost $200 bucks only for few months , it definitely not satisfied, now im decide to give samsung wireless a try , since apple dont last for a long time ...",9932,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"had the airpods for 4 months and they were amazing. sound quality was great, felt very comfortable, the whole nine yards. i loved these earbuds. after 4 months, without warning it just stopped working. it connects to my samsung phone, but it doesn't play any sound. ok weird, i'll just put it back in the case and take it out again (disconnect then reconnect). still the same issue. try to unpair the earbuds and pair them back and still nothing. put the earbuds in the case and held the button to reset it until it gets that amber light and still nothing. i then thought ok maybe it's because i'm not using an iphone, so i get my old iphone 6 and try to connect it to that and see if it fixes it and what do ya know nothing. i kept resetting it so many times and i finally got one earbud to play sound. right earbud plays sound and left one doesn't, ok cool progress. i tried resetting it a couple more times and now the left one plays sound but the right one doesn't. continued resetting it and now the right earbud plays sound but the left one doesn't. it sucks, but at least i can still use one earbud. i'll continue to try and see if i can get both ear buds to work and if i do i'll update this review, but until then it's a 1 star for me :/",9969,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"let me start this review by saying that i'm using these pods with a blackberry priv that has an android os, so take that fwiw.  maybe they aren't compatible, or optimally compatible, or whatever since they're an apple device.  i don't know, but the point of having them is to be able to listen to my phone without wires, and they don't allow that very well.the range is limited, like less than a few feet, and depending on where i'm using them it's less than that.  for example, i can be at the gym on an incline bench, set my phone on the floor next to me, and the podcast that i'm listening to cuts out. maybe there's interference from the gym's piped in music - they work well enough when they're about 10 inches away from me in the rack on the elliptical machine.this afternoon i was washing my car in my garage.  when i was washing the tires i left the phone on the hood of the car, and when i went to wash the rear tires, my podcast cut out.  i ended up turning them off them and using the speaker in the phone.the only time these pods really work is when i'm driving and i have my phone on my lap.  ymmv depending on how, when, and where you use them.",9989,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"update: i've had these for six months and the case has stopped charging. they are essentially useless now. i would recommend purchasing through apple so you can get another pair if yours malfunctions. since i purchased on here and the return window is closed, i cannot get another pair, which means $130 down the drain.this was definitely one of my best amazon purchases. the sound quality on these is amazing even during phone calls. the charging case holds an impressive amount of charge so i only need to recharge it once every 2-3 days, which isn't very much considering i use these 8-10 hours a day.at work. that being said, there are some cons to these. the battery life of the airpods themselves isn't the best-- you'll get 1-2 hours max. now, five minutes in the charging case will get these back to full charge, so take that with a grain of salt. the biggest con for me has been the bluetooth connectivity. i have an iphone 11 so i would expect these to have no issues with connecting. however, every few times i use these, one or both of the airpods does not connect when i pull it out of the case. it usually takes about five minutes to figure out the problem and re-connect them. it's definitely a problem when i'm trying to pick up a call on my airpods or listen to something quickly. for that reason, i'd give these 4/5 stars. they're still worth the purchase but i'd recommend adding applecare so you can get a replacement if you have the same issues. (p.s. if you have an apple watch, these do not connect independently to the apple watch, you will need to have your iphone on you.)",9994,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

1.  one pod was muffled while other pod was fine.  fully charged and tried again.  independently confirmed faulty pod with different iphones of 20-somethings.2.  caked piece of dirt under closed case lid.  was located both on underside of lid near hinge and the surface where the pods are inserted - in plain sight.  tried to scrape off but could not.  packaging was clearly factory from outside to inside.between dirt and defective equipment it sure seemed like manufacturer repackaged faulty and/or poor quality control.  not a good look for mothers day with family around.  wife deserves upgrade to noise cancelling. returning for replacement.  hopefully wife gets before school year over (kindergarten teacher using zoom).,10038,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i received the airpods today and they paired to my phone as expected. i used them for about 30 minutes and then charged them (they still had a charge of about 60%). i opened the case next to my iphone and the phone showed them connected and fully charged. i then took out the airpods and placed them in my ears and started an audiobook. the sound came through the speakers in my phone and the airpods weren't working. i opened settings on my phone and did everything i could find online to pair them after unpairing as the phone required me to do because it couldn't connect. i went to ""get product support"" on the order page and spoke with customer service who walked me through the same steps i already took to try and pair the airpods. i could not get them to pair. my wife's airpods paired fine with my phone so i ruled out a problem with my phone. amazon customer service connected me with apple customer service and they are replacing the airpods, however, i have a $215  credit authorization on my credit card pending their reception of the defective airpods which must not be damaged. i don't think this is the norm for apple products but sometimes you get a bad product. i think amazon should have sent me a new pair with case and taken the defective ones as any local store would have done. amazon shouldn't have referred me to apple for replacement. the lesson i learned is that you don't ever click on ""get product support"" but you do click on ""return and replace"".",10040,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"my niece has had hers for a while and loved them. so i thought i would give them a try.the first issue i have with them is the battery does not last longer than 3 hours. (that might be my bad, maybe they are not designed to.) if i am going to be on a call longer than 3 hours, i do like that i can use one earbud and the other can stay charging in the case. i do lose any noise canceling that it does that way. in addition sometimes the one earbud will not have audio. i have to put in and take it out of the case a few times to get it to work, so as long as i try switching the earbud before the one dies i can talk longer than 3 hours.the next issue i have is they do not always connect to my iphone 11 and/or my samsung note 10+. i actually have better luck with the samsung than the iphone. once i get the samsung to connect it will almost always do so, the audio might cut in and out but they connect. the iphone on the other hand will say it is connected but there will be no audio. it is frustrating, maybe it is the two phones that cause the issues, i am not sure. i bought them because so many loved them, but i would not recommend them at unless you really do not talk long on your phone and only  had one phone. then maybe you would have less issues than i have had.",10250,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"as with (in my opinion) all apple products , the quality is incredibly good. the sound quality is amazing. big problem for me however - my ear shape causes these airpods to fall out constantly. i have tried everything including rubbing the inside of my ears and the airpods with isopropyl alcohol to make sure there was no body oils that could make things slip. nothing helped.  unless i was pretty much motionless, these things fell out.  trying to run or ride a bike is out of the question. i have ordered an aftermarket rubber tip kit to hopefully help this problem. the reason i write this is to let people know that while the product quality is great, if your ears aren't shaped the right way these airpods will be useless and a source of great frustration.  especially since they come at a premium price.",10299,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"we've been so tired of using clunky headphones or the terrible fall-out all the time  earbuds apple provides, that we thought we'd order the air pods.we have lots of apple products - an ipad, a macbook pro, and a couple i phones.we're not luddites, but we're not super computer savvy either - we don't program for instance.i was excited to give these a try.  if you can get them to work, the sound is beautiful and clear.  it was relatively easy to pair the pods to the iphones.  but, we still can't pair them to the ipad, and though we've had the ear pods for a week, we've only been able to pair them with the macbook pro one time.they come in a small package like a dental floss container.  as it turns out, there is a teeny tiny button to press on the back of the container.  it is well disguised.  they could have done something better so that your hand could feel the teeny tiny indent button, but i had to use a magnifying glass and strong light to discover it.  they should paint it with a red dot.  the only time i got the macbook pro to work, i had to get on my i phone and select the air pods there.some things to know:  when you're trying to pair, make sure your ear pods are in the case and that the case is well charged.  then open the case and press the invisible button. look inside the case and see if the inner tiny light has changed from green to flashing white.  if the case is flashing, place the case near the item you want to pair with.  make sure your iphone is de-selected and maybe your air pods will pair with your ipad or macbook pro.  maybe,doesn't it seem like a big company like apple could have made these more user friendly?we tried about 10 u tube videos trying to get these to work.",10389,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"i feel like i got scammed! advertisement and the sale for the airpods 2nd gen is as follows: one pair wireless charging more expensive, they second pair cheaper and plug in. the way you choose your airpods from this seller is the same so it’s easy to come to the assumption that both are 2nd gen. so i feel like the labeling was on purpose to sale (obsolete merchandise) which cost me money and i ended up buying a product i didn’t want. i feel taken advantage of as a consumer i’ve never owned airpods because they’re pricey however being that my ipad and my iphone have different charging ports it’s hard to have just one pair of headphones for them i broke down and decided it was worth the convenience. its sellers like this one that made me want to buy directly from the website and as soon as amazon reopens it’s call center i plan to make a full complaint. please know what you’re buying be careful today sellers will take advantage of consumers with no sense of guilt after all it’s nothing but profit for them. i gave this product three stars because it is an apple product it was in new condition although it was not what i thought i purchased. don’t trust amazon to make sellers sell quality products, not everything you buy comes from them. the pair i current own work fine but i just paid 140 plus tax for first generation!!!! get me once shame on you!!!",10391,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"this is the worst product. i’ve had it for only a 3 months and the sound has gotten weaker and weaker no matter what i do. it’s disappointing because the product was lost, then it was late and now it barley works.i thought to myself maybe it’s fake?",10425,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"they didnt work, would love a refund.",10426,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i have used airpods before for 5 months  before i lost them. i thought since these were on sale i should get them but these are most likely fake or defected. in just 3 months of using them they are already breaking up on sounds, not connecting with my iphone properly and running out of battery in less than 1 hour of using. i will say skip the hassle, save your money and buy from apple store.",10427,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

they would be great but the left one won’t charge at all. the sound from the right is great and they stay charged a long time. i guess i got a dud.,10434,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

left earbud stopped working after a few months,10436,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
these airpods came to me with the right air broken. i had to take time out of my busy week to visit the apple store and replace it. not worth buying-if you want airpods buy them at the apple store.,10437,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"hello,-i have owned my airpods for only 10 months & the battery life is now only 4 hrs.-when i first bought & used them...battery life was maybe 6 hrs?-plus, apple has admitted it was slowing down older iphones.-in a settlement they have to pay $500 million dollars.-amazon rejected my last product review because, i put the web address on here about the lawsuit.thank you, david.",10438,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"price fluctuations, poor fit & sound just aren’t worth the value of going wireless. maybe airpod pro’s would be if not so expensive. regular airpods are made for huge ears... the idea that one size fits all is ridiculous. trying to cram an airpod into my ear, hear the music & keep it lodged in there is a total waste of money. watching prices fluctuate is crazy as well.",10439,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
they just dont stay in place .. and do not auto connect all the time ... other than that these do sound very good ...,10440,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

we purchased these 6 months ago and they no longer work correctly.  the volume doesn’t go up on them.  a lot of money for a product that doesn’t last.,10445,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

poor fitting (for me). great sound,10448,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
since fall in january already had to replace once because the sound and one of the pods was not coming out very well getting ready to take them back for the second time,10449,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
broke within a month. amazon would not let me return them. i will never purchase a high dollar items in the future as i'm stuck with broken air pods.,10450,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"it’s exactly what you asked for, air-pods. everything is good the noise canceling is trash along with volume compared to any traditional headphones. the battery life is good for being so light and small. the sound quality is affected by the lack of noise cancelation.update after a month or 2 owning these. a lot of people say that i sound like i’m far away, or muffled. it happens alot. barely any bass, if non at all. pretty uncomfortable in the ears too over an extended period of time. it is what it is.",10451,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

one is already not working.,10453,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"the sound quality is very good but when using them for a phone call (which was the main reason i bought them), i was told that my voice was breaking up. plus they fell out of my ears a few times and they’re too expensive to risk losing. unfortunately, i decided to return them.",10454,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i haven’t had good luck with electronics on amazon. these broke after 2 months of very light use. they were wonderful while they lasted. now they are useless. threw them away. contacted customer service time and time again with no resolution. complete waste of money.,10455,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
it’s no good,10456,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
one airpod stopped working right after the return date policy ended. now i'm stuck with only one working airpod. what a waste of money!,10457,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
theyre ok,10458,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
honest review: these are great....in theory.no cord! / hassle free/ sound works great. only when the sound wants to work. this device will not hold a charge. i am constantly charging and when it does decide to charge i get lucky if one airpod holds a charge while the other one dies/ rarely works. too much of a hassle to be honest. i spend more time trying to get these to charge then i actually use them. not worth it it. i just returned today. just going to use my corded iphone headphones instead. at least those are reliable.,10459,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
bought these for my son for christmas and already having issues. sound is intermittent on the left then right after cleaning them. when they work they are awesome... when... they ... work and have tried all the ‘support’ techniques and still the same.,10460,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
i replaced them 3 times and the left ear stopped working it was low in all 3. waste of my money.,10461,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
when i first connected them to my phone it already had a name. which means they were previously owned. no where in the ad did it say used.,10462,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i’ve only had them a week, and they’ve already started having problems. the right and left alternate between not working. they also sometimes say they’re connected, and then won’t play any sound.",10463,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

the left airpod stopped working after 6 months.  i cleaned them on a regular basis and the volume kept drifting from loud to soft after having them for 2 months.  .  total waste of money.,10465,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
the left air pod does not work if u want to use only oneeverything else work,10466,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

doesn’t stay in ears,10468,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
these air pods are great for sound but i find my pair quite glitchy. they do not connect to my devices without me having to take them out and put them back in numerous times and hope they connect. the battery life isn't all that great either. they last maybe a few hours then need to be charged in the case. i do have to say the case keeps a good charge and it doesn't take very long to charge the air pods which is great. the concept of them are great and they actually stay in my ears which was one concern i had.,10469,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
the left one stopped working well after only a couple months so now i can only use the right one,10470,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
the audio keeps going out but otherwise good,10471,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i got airpods because i wanted to use the same headphones w my phone and my laptop without getting a dongle. they honestly arent super great. they do the job, but the battery life isnt great and they dont stay in your ears well. also absolutely no noise cancellation",10472,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"nice headphones, the audio quality is subpar for the price you pay. plenty other alternatives that sound significantly better, imo. the only plus side for these is that they have the h1 chip, which allows airpods to pair immediately to any iphone, ipad, mac, etc.",10473,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
had to take into apple within a couple weeks because of high pitched noise.,10474,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

the charger that came with the ear pods did not work. very disappointing! we had to get another charging cable.,10476,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
they worked really well then one day at the gym i noticed if i turned my head a certain way then the music would come through clearly and if it was not like that it cut out. i looked very weird to a gym-goer.,10477,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"airpods are amazing as a product but they have some serious issues. one airpod often will become uncharged for no apparent reason, even after it’s been left in the case to charge overnight.",10478,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i’ve owned these for a month and debated returning them a few times. 1.) i’m pretty sure the pair i received was not “new” even though they appeared to be. it seemed like someone may have tried them, returned them and they were repackaged to appear new. i thought i might be being paranoid having received multiple used items across amazon at this point, so i cleaned them and decided to keep. 2.) i am currently waiting on a replacement for the left pod less than a month in. it had a defective battery right out of the box. i’m not sure if that’s apple’s fault or if someone else got them and returned for the same reason. either way apple is replacing it free of charge since it dies within 30 minutes on a full charge (so at least they’re real).i like the airpods but i’m not sure i trust amazon with these purchases anymore. i probably wouldn’t buy them on amazon again.",10479,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"i'm an apple fan and really wanted to like these!...quick take -- convenient, but uncomfortable, too quiet, only one control, and not water-resistantthe setup and automatic pairing make these really convenient to use. however, for the apple premium price, there are a few things that just come up way too short for me:- build quality is poor, leaving sharp edges where the plastic pieces meet. this gets really painful when you're taking them in and out throughout the day (i've tried 3 pairs, thinking i might have got a dud, and only 1 of the 6 pods had smooth edges).- the only control is double-tap. this is apple -- i'd expect a few more touch options. can't control volume.- way too quiet. it also seems obvious that pods that have no isolation or noise cancelling (for the sake of the design, which i understand) should have a lot of headroom for volume. not the case with these.- not even water resistant, which is really disappointing. i'm nervous walking with them if it's raining or snowing. we have the technology...",10480,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
"they’re ok, just need to have an off button",10481,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

"this product was dead on arrival and given as a birthday gift.  instead of celebrating this event, we unboxed it and called for help and amazon refused to do anything to resolve the issue and just punted to apple who only wants to run me in circles troubleshooting a dead on arrival premium priced item.very dissatisfied with the experience. what happened to the excellent customer service you used have?",10487,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

great product other than staying in your ears. if you are active and run forget it.... every 10 secs you have to apply pressure to stop them from falling out. get an active pair that hooks to your ear.,10492,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
they're great if you have an apple phone but if you have a android based phone not so good i mean they sound really well but all the features that you get with an apple phone and the buds you don't get with an android phone or if there is somebody let me know how to get the extra icons that you get with an apple phone,10493,negative,Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)
